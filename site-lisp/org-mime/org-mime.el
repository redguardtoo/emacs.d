;; WYSWYG, html mime composition using org-mode
;;
;; For mail composed using the orgstruct-mode minor mode, this
;; provides a function for converting all or part of your mail buffer
;; to embedded html as exported by org-mode.  Call `org-mime-htmlize'
;; in a message buffer to convert either the active region or the
;; entire buffer to html.
;;
;; Similarly the `org-mime-org-buffer-htmlize' function can be called
;; from within an org-mode buffer to convert the buffer to html, and
;; package the results into an email handling with appropriate MIME
;; encoding.
;;
;; `org-mime-org-subtree-htmlize' is similar to `org-mime-org-buffer-htmlize'
;; but works on subtree. It can also read subtree properties MAIL_SUBJECT,
;; MAIL_TO, MAIL_CC, and MAIL_BCC. Here is the sample of subtree:
;;
;; * mail one
;;   :PROPERTIES:
;;   :MAIL_SUBJECT: mail title
;;   :MAIL_TO: person1@gmail.com
;;   :MAIL_CC: person2@gmail.com
;;   :MAIL_BCC: person3@gmail.com
;;   :END:
;;
;; To avoid exporting TOC, you can setup `org-mime-export-options',
;;   (setq org-mime-export-options '(:section-numbers nil
;;                                   :with-author nil
;;                                   :with-toc nil))
;; Or just setup your export options in org buffer/subtree which is overrided
;; by `org-mime-export-options' when it's NOT nil.
;;
;; You can change `org-mime-up-subtree-heading' before exporting subtree.
;; heck its documentation.
;;
;; Quick start:
;; Write mail in message-mode, make sure the mail body follows org format.
;; Before sending mail, `M-x org-mime-htmlize'
;;
;; Setup (OPTIONAL):
;; you might want to bind this to a key with something like the
;; following message-mode binding
;;
;;   (add-hook 'message-mode-hook
;;             (lambda ()
;;               (local-set-key (kbd "C-c M-o") 'org-mime-htmlize)))
;;
;; and the following org-mode binding
;;
;;   (add-hook 'org-mode-hook
;;             (lambda ()
;;               (local-set-key (kbd "C-c M-o") 'org-mime-org-buffer-htmlize)))
