;;
;; Version 1.4 - 2010-09 - David Capello
;; * Renamed from command-frequency to keyfreq
;; * Now keyfreq-table holds "deltas"
;; * Removed a lot of "facility" functions to keep the code simple.
;; * Rename keyfreq-summarize-all-modes -> keyfreq-groups-major-modes.
;; * Added keyfreq-filter-major-mode
;; * Added lock file to avoid overwrite the file by two processes at
;;   the same time.
;;
;; Version 1.3 - 2009-09 - David Capello
;; * Added keyfreq-summarize-all-modes
;;
;; Version 1.2 - 2009-09 - David Capello
;; * Now each hash hash-key is a (major-mode . command) cons. Now only
;;   symbols are recorded.
;;
;; Version 1.1 - 2008-09
;; - Replaced the use of this-command var by real-last-command, so
;;   that the commands backward-kill-word, kill-word, kill-line,
;;   kill-region, do not all get counted as kill-region. Changed
;;   post-command-hook to pre-command-hook
;;
;; Version 1.0 - 2007
;; - Made into a full featured minor mode.  Added full doc
;;   strings. Added feature to save and read to disk the frequency
;;   hash table. Added ability to set user preference using emacs's
;;   customization system. Code is ~400 lines. This version is made by
;;   Michal Nazarewicz in 2007.
;;
;; Version 0.1 - 2006
;; - First version by Ryan Yeske. A quick hack of about 40 lines.

;;
;; HOW TO USE IT?
;;
;; Include the following lines in your .emacs file:
;;
;;   (require 'keyfreq)
;;   (keyfreq-mode 1)
;;   (keyfreq-autosave-mode 1)
;;
;; And use keyfreq-show to see how many times you used a command.
