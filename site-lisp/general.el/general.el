;;; Commentary:
;; This package provides convenient wrappers for more succinctly defining
;; keybindings. It allows defining multiple keys at once, specifying an
;; arbitrary number of named prefix keys to be used in key definitions,
;; implicitly wrapping key strings with (kbd ...), and more. It provides a
;; single function for standard emacs key definitions as well as evil key
;; definitions for any evil state and any keymap. It also provides a setup
;; function to generate "nmap", "vmap", etc. keybinding functions for evil.

;; For more information see the README in the online repository.

  "The primary key definition function provided by general.

PREFIX corresponds to a prefix key and defaults to none. STATES corresponds to
the evil state(s) to bind the keys in. Non-evil users should not set STATES.
When STATES is non-nil, `evil-define-key' will be used. Otherwise `define-key'
will be used. Evil users may also want to leave STATES nil and set KEYMAPS to
a keymap such as `evil-normal-state-map' for global mappings. KEYMAPS defaults
to `global-map'. Note that STATES and KEYMAPS can either be a list or a single
symbol. If any keymap does not exist, the keybindings will be deferred until
the keymap does exist, so using `eval-after-load' is not necessary with this
function.

If NON-NORMAL-PREFIX is specified, this prefix will be used for emacs and insert
state keybindings instead of PREFIX. This argument will only have an effect if
'insert and/or 'emacs is one of the STATES or if 'evil-insert-state-map and/or
'evil-emacs-state-map is one of the KEYMAPS. Alternatively, GLOBAL-PREFIX can be
used with PREFIX and/or NON-NORMAL-PREFIX to bind keys in all states under a
specified prefix. Like with NON-NORMAL-PREFIX, GLOBAL-PREFIX will prevent PREFIX
from applying to insert and emacs states. Note that these keywords are only
useful for evil users.

INFIX can be used to append a string to all of the specified prefixes. This is
potentially useful when you are using GLOBAL-PREFIX and/or NON-NORMAL-PREFIX so
that you can sandwich keys in between all the prefixes and the specified keys in
MAPS. This may be particularly useful if you are using default prefixes in a
wrapper so that you can add to them without needing to re-specify all of them.
If none of the other prefix arguments are specified, INFIX will have no effect.

If PREFIX-COMMAND is specified, a prefix keymap/command will be created using
`define-prefix-command' as long as the symbol specified is not already bound (to
ensure that an existing prefix keymap is not overwritten if the
`general-define-key' function is re-evaluated). All prefixes will then be bound
to PREFIX-COMMAND. PREFIX-MAP and PREFIX-NAME can additionally be specified and
are used as the last two arguments to `define-prefix-command'.

Unlike with normal key definitions functions, the keymaps in KEYMAPS should be
quoted (this makes it easy to check if there is only one keymap instead of a
list of keymaps).

MAPS will be recorded for later use with `general-describe-keybindings'."

MAPS consists of <key> <command> pairs. If a key in MAPS is matched, the

one of the key sequences from MAPS, the FALLBACK-COMMAND will be run followed by
the simulated keypresses of \"ab\". Prefix arguments will still work regardless
of which command is run. This is useful for binding under non-prefix keys. For
example, this can be used to redefine a sequence like \"cw\" or \"cow\" in evil
but still have \"c\" work as `evil-change'. If TIMEOUT is specified,
FALLBACK-COMMAND will also be run in the case that the user does not press the
next key within the TIMEOUT (e.g. 0.5).

NAME and DOCSTRING are optional keyword arguments. They can be used to replace
the automatically generated name and docstring for the created function and are
potentially useful if you want to create multiple, different commands using the

When INHERIT-KEYMAP is specified, all the keybindings from that keymap will be
inherited in MAPS.
