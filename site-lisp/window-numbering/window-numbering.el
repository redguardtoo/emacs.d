;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Enable window-numbering-mode and use M-1 through M-0 to navigate.
;;
;; If you want to affect the numbers, use window-numbering-before-hook or
;; window-numbering-assign-func.
;; For instance, to always assign the calculator window the number 9, add the
;; following to your .emacs:
;;
;; (setq window-numbering-assign-func
;;       (lambda () (when (equal (buffer-name) "*Calculator*") 9)))
;;
;;; Changes Log:
;;
;;    Fix numbering of minibuffer for recent Emacs versions.
;;
;; 2013-03-23 (1.1.2)
;;    Fix numbering in terminal mode with menu bar visible.
;;    Add face for window number.  (thanks to Chen Bin)
;;
;; 2008-04-11 (1.1.1)
;;    Added possibility to delete window with prefix arg.
;;    Cleaned up code and migrated to `defcustom'.
;;
;; 2007-02-18 (1.1)
;;    Added window-numbering-before-hook, window-numbering-assign-func.
