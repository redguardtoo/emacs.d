;;; Commentary:

;; This program extract big words from text.
;; The words whose Zipf frequency less than `mybigword-upper-limit' are
;; big words.
;;
;; Zipf scale was proposed by Marc Brysbaert, who created the SUBTLEX lists.
;; Zipf frequency of a word is the base-10 logarithm of the number of times it
;; appears per billion words.
;;
;; A word with Zipf value 6 appears once per thousand words,for example, and a
;; word with Zipf value 3 appears once per million words.
;;
;; Reasonable Zipf values are between 0 and 8, but the minimum Zipf value
;; appearing here is 1.0.
;;
;; We use 0 as the default Zipf value for words that do not appear in the given
;; word list,although it should mean one occurrence per billion words."
;;
;; Thanks to https://github.com/LuminosoInsight/wordfreq for providing the data.
;;
;; Usage,
;;
;;   Run `mybigword-show-big-words-from-file'
;;   Run `mybigword-show-big-words-from-current-buffer'
;;
;;
;; Customize `mybigword-excluded-words' or `mybigword-personal-excluded-words' to
;; exclude words.
;;
;; Tips,
;;
;;   1. Customize `mybigword-default-format-function' to format the word for display.
;;   If it's `mybigword-format-with-dictionary', the `dictionary-definition' is used to
;;   find the definitions of all big words.
;;
;;   Sample to display the dictionary definitions of big words:
;;
;;     (let* ((mybigword-default-format-function 'mybigword-format-with-dictionary))
;;       (mybigword-show-big-words-from-current-buffer))
;;
;;   You can also set `mybigword-default-format-header-function' to add a header before
;;   displaying words.
;;
;;   Customize `mybigword-hide-word-function' to hide word for display
;;
;;
;;   2. Parse the *.srt to play the video containing the word in org file
;;   Make sure the org tree node has the property SRT_PATH.
;;   Mplayer is required to play the video.  See `mybigword-mplayer-program' for details.
;;
;;   Sample of org file:
;;    * Star Trek s06e26
;;      :PROPERTIES:
;;      :SRT_PATH: ~/Star.Trek.DS9-s06e26.Tears.of.the.Prophets.srt
;;      :END:
;;    telepathic egotist
;;
;;   Move focus over the word like "egotist".  Run "M-x mybigword-play-video-of-word-at-point".
;;   Then mplayer plays the corresponding video at the time the word is spoken.
;;
;;   Please note `mybigword-play-video-of-word-at-point' can be used in other major modes.
;;   See `mybigword-default-video-info-function' for details.
;;
;;
;;   3. Use `mybigword-pronounce-word' to pronounce the word at point.
;;   The word's audio is downloaded from https://dictionary.cambridge.org
;;   The audio download url could be customized in `mybigword-default-audio-url-function'.
