experimental support for proof by pointing.

There is support for X Symbol, but not using a proper token language.

There is a tags program, legotags.

Installation notes:

Install legotags in a standard place or add <proofgeneral-home>/lego 
to your PATH.
NB: You may need to change the path to perl at the top of the file.

Generate a TAGS file for the Lego library by running
	legotags `find . -name \*.l -print`
in the root directory of the library.
