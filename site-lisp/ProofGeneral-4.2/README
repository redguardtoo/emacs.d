	    Proof General --- Organize your proofs! 

Proof General is a generic Emacs interface for proof assistants.
The aim of the Proof General project is to provide a powerful, generic
environment for using interactive proof assistants.

This is version 4.2 (prerelease) of Proof General.  See About for exact version.
It is built for Emacs 23.3.

The code *may* also work with previous emacs versions, back as far as
Emacs 22.3.  But you will need to regenerated the byte-compiled files
with "make clean; make compile".  Backward compatibility cannot be
guaranteed.

See
    INSTALL	     for installation details.
    COPYING	     for license details.
    COMPATIBILITY    for version compatibility information.

Supported proof assistants:  Coq, Isabelle, LEGO, PhoX
Experimental (less useful):  CCC,ACL2,HOL98,Hol-Light,Lambda-Clam,Shell,Twelf
        Obsolete instances:  Demoisa,Lambda-Clam,Plastic

A few example proofs are included in each prover subdirectory.  The
"root2" proofs of the irrationality of the square root of 2 were
proofs written for Freek Wiedijk's challenge in his comparison of
different theorem provers, see http://www.cs.kun.nl/~freek/comparison/.  
Those proof scripts are copyright by their named authors.  
(NB: most of these have rusted)
