;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides a number of hacks that are necessary for MMM
;; Mode to function in different Emacsen.  MMM Mode is designed for
;; FSF Emacs 20 and 21, but these hacks usually enable it to work
;; almost perfectly in Emacs 19 and XEmacs 20 or 21.

;;; Code:

(require 'cl)

;;{{{ Emacsen Detection

(defvar mmm-xemacs (featurep 'xemacs)
  "Whether we are running XEmacs.")

;;}}}
;;{{{ Keywords (Emacs 19)

;; Emacs 19 doesn't automatically set keyword variables to themselves.
;; We shouldn't have to do any more than these, since CL automatically
;; defines all keywords used for function arguments.

  '(:group :regexp :region :function :insert :classes :private)
  "List of extra keywords used by MMM Mode.")

;;{{{ Overlays (XEmacs)

;; The main thing we use from FSF Emacs that XEmacs doesn't support
;; are overlays. XEmacs uses extents instead, but comes with a package
;; to emulate overlays.
(when mmm-xemacs
  ;; This does almost everything we need.

;; We also use a couple "special" overlay properties which have
;; different names for XEmacs extents.

  "The name of the overlay property controlling evaporation.")

;; We don't use this any more, since its behavior is different in FSF
;; and XEmacs: in the one it replaces the buffer's local map, but in
;; the other it gets stacked on top of it. Instead we just set the
;; buffer's local map temporarily.
;;;(defvar mmm-keymap-property

;;{{{ Keymaps and Events (XEmacs)

;; In XEmacs, keymaps are a primitive type, while in FSF Emacs, they
;; are a list whose car is the symbol `keymap'. Among other things,
;; this means that they handle default bindings differently.

  (if (featurep 'xemacs)
      `(set-keymap-default-binding ,keymap ,binding)
    `(define-key ,keymap [t] ,binding)))

;; In XEmacs, events are a primitive type, while in FSF Emacs, they
;; are represented by characters or vectors. We treat them as vectors.
;; We can use `event-modifiers' in both Emacsen to extract the
;; modifiers, but the function to extract the basic key is different.
(defmacro mmm-event-key (event)
  (if (featurep 'xemacs)
      `(event-key ,event)
    `(event-basic-type ,event)))

;;{{{ Skeleton (XEmacs)

;; XEmacs' `skeleton' package doesn't provide `@' to record positions.

This makes `@' in skeletons act approximately like it does in FSF."

;;{{{ Font Lock Defaults (XEmacs)

(defmacro mmm-set-font-lock-defaults ()
  "Set font-lock defaults without trying to turn font-lock on.
In XEmacs, `font-lock-set-defaults' calls `font-lock-set-defaults-1'
to do the real work but then `turn-on-font-lock', which in turn calls
`font-lock-mode', which unsets the defaults if running in a hidden
buffer \(name begins with a space).  So in XEmacs, we just call
`font-lock-set-defaults-1' directly."
