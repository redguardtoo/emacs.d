                          MMM Mode for Emacs
                          ==================

OVERVIEW

  MMM Mode is a minor mode for Emacs that allows Multiple Major Modes
  to coexist in one buffer.  It is well-suited to editing:

  * Preprocessed code, such as server-side Perl or PHP embedded in HTML
  * Code generating code, such as HTML output by CGI scripts
  * Embedded code, such as Javascript in HTML
  * Literate programming: code interspersed with documentation, e.g. Noweb

INSTALLATION

  MMM Mode has a standard GNU configure-driven installation.  (See the
  file INSTALL for generic instructions, most of which don't apply.)
  To install in the standard locations, unpack the archive, `cd' to
  the mmm-mode-X.X.X directory created, and run these commands:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

  Alternately, since currently MMM Mode is written in pure Emacs Lisp,
  you could just copy all the *.el files in the distribution to a
  directory in your `load-path', and optionally byte-compile them
  manually (see the Emacs Manual).  The configure installation also
  installs the MMM Mode info manual in your site info directory, so if
  you're installing manually, you might want to do that too.

  If you're installing from the CVS version, you won't have the
  configure script.  If you have the automake/autoconf tools
  installed, you can run the script `autogen.sh' first, and then
  proceed as above.  Otherwise, you'll have to copy the *.el files
  manually as described above.

  If you have more than one version of emacs installed and want to
  use MMM in a version other than /usr/bin/emacs, you must set the
  environment variable EMACS before running `configure', e.g.

    EMACS=/usr/bin/xemacs ./configure
    make
    make install

  If you want to use MMM in more than one version of emacs, you must
  either have separate site-lisp directories (such as Debian does), or
  load it from source every time; byte-compiled files are not portable
  between emacsen.

CONFIGURATION

  Once MMM Mode is installed, it has to be configured correctly.  This
  can be done in a site-start file or in user's initialization files;
  usually the latter is preferable, except possibly for autoloads.
  First the package needs to be loaded, with either

    (require 'mmm-mode)

  or instead, to save time during emacs startup,

    (require 'mmm-auto)

  Then you will probably want to set something like this:

    (setq mmm-global-mode 'maybe)
    (mmm-add-mode-ext-class 'html-mode "\\.php\\'" 'html-php)

  The first line tells MMM Mode to load itself whenever you open an
  appropriate file, and the second is an example which says to notice
  PHP regions in html-mode files having a `.php' extension.  Both
  lines are necessary.

  You will, of course, want to change and duplicate the second line
  according to your needs. either of the first two parameters can be
  `nil', meaning not to consider that criterion.  For example, if all
  your html files, regardless of extension, are Mason components, you
  will want something like:

    (mmm-add-mode-ext-class 'html-mode nil 'mason)

  whereas if all your files with a `.nw' extension, regardless of
  primary mode (some may be LaTeX, others HTML, say) are Noweb, you
  will prefer

    (mmm-add-mode-ext-class nil "\\.nw\\'" 'noweb)

  See the info file for more extensive documentation, and for other
  configuration options.

  the documentation strings of functions and variables, the comments
  in the source code, and the source code itself.
