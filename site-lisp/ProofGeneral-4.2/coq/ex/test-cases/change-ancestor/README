One can add text at the end of an completely locked ancestor.
When this text is asserted the following should happen
- retract the current scripting buffer, thereby unlocking all ancestors
- restart Coq
- start asserting at the beginning of the ancestor

To reproduce the test do the following:
- visit b.v and assert at least the initial Require command in it
  (this will lock the ancestor a.v)
- visit the ancestor a.v and add the following text at the end

  Definition b := a.

- assert that with proof-assert-next-command-interactive or
  proof-goto-point


This test case triggers a bug in the cvs version from
2011-05-12 12:10:00 UTC. The bug has been fixed, see issue 
http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/trac/ticket/400 .

The bug is that after unlocking the
ancestor a.v, only the newly added text is sent to Coq. Therefore
Coq responds with an error (reference a was not found in the
current environment). When one asserts a.v from the beginning,
the definition of b is of course accepted.
