b/b.v depends on a/a.v and the code is correct because of Add
LoadPath in b.

Scripting b/b.v works if coq-recompile-before-require is set to
nil and if a/a.v is compiled manually.

This problem is not considered a bug, but a feature that does not
make much sense to implement, because apparently nobody is using
Add LoadPath.

Note that not even coqdep is able to handle b/b.v correctly!
