Future
======

The aim of the Proof General project is to provide powerful environments
and tools for interactive proof.

Proof General has been Emacs based so far and uses heavy per-prover
customisation.  The Proof General Kit project proposes that proof
assistants use a standard XML-based protocol for interactive proof,
dubbed PGIP.  PGIP will enable middleware for interactive proof tools
and interface components.  Rather than configuring Proof General for
your proof assistant, you will need to configure your proof assistant
to understand PGIP.  There is a similarity however; the design of PGIP
was based heavily on the Emacs Proof General framework.

At the time of writing, the Proof General Kit software is in a prototype
stage and the PGIP protocol is still being refined.  We have a prototype
Proof General plugin for the Eclipse IDE and a prototype version of a
PGIP-enabled Isabelle.  There is also a middleware component for
co-ordinating proof written in Haskell, the Proof General Broker.
Further collaborations are sought for more developments, especially the
PGIP enabling of other provers.  For more details, see the Proof
General Kit webpage (http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/kit).  Help us to
help you organize your proofs!

Credits
=======

The original developers of the basis of Proof General were:

   * David Aspinall,

   * Healfdene Goguen,

   * Thomas Kleymann, and

   * Dilip Sequeira.

LEGO Proof General (the successor of `lego-mode') was written by Thomas
Kleymann and Dilip Sequeira.  It is no longer maintained.  Coq Proof
General was written by Healfdene Goguen, with later contributions from
Patrick Loiseleur.  It is now maintained by Pierre Courtieu.  Isabelle
Proof General was written and is being maintained by David Aspinall.
It has benefited greatly from tweaks and suggestions by Markus Wenzel,
who wrote the first support for Isar and added Proof General support
inside Isabelle.  David von Oheimb supplied the original patches for
X-Symbol support, which improved Proof General significantly.
Christoph Wedler, the author of X-Symbol, provided much useful support
in adapting his package for PG.

The generic base for Proof General was developed by Kleymann, Sequeira,
Goguen and Aspinall. It follows some of the ideas used in Project CROAP
(http://www.inria.fr/croap/). The project to implement a proof mode for
LEGO was initiated in 1994 and coordinated until October 1998 by Thomas
Kleymann, becoming generic along the way.  In October 1998, the project
became Proof General and has been managed by David Aspinall since then.

This manual was written by David Aspinall and Thomas Kleymann, with
words borrowed from user documentation of LEGO mode, prepared by Dilip
Sequeira.  Healfdene Goguen wrote some text for Coq Proof General.
Since Proof General 2.0, this manual has been maintained by David
Aspinall, with contributions from Pierre Courtieu, Markus Wenzel and
Hendrik Tews.

The Proof General project has benefited from (indirect) funding by EPSRC
(Applications of a Type Theory Based Proof Assistant in the late 1990s
and The Integration and Interaction of Multiple Mathematical Reasoning
Processes, EP/E005713/1 (RA0084) in 2006-8), the EC (the Co-ordination
Action Types and previous related projects), and the support of the
LFCS.  Version 3.1 was prepared whilst David Aspinall was visiting ETL,
Japan, supported by the British Council.

For Proof General 3.7, Graham Dutton helped with web pages and
infrastructure; since then the the computing support team at the School
of Informatics have given help.  For testing and feedback for older
versions of Proof General, thanks go to Rod Burstall, Martin Hofmann,
and James McKinna, and several on the longer list below.

For the Proof General 4.0 release, special thanks go to Stefan Monnier
for patches and suggestions, to Makarius for many bug reports and help
with Isabelle support and to Pierre Courtieu for providing new features
for Coq support.

During the development of Proof General 3.x and 4.x releases, many
people helped provide testing and other feedback, including the Proof
General maintainers, Paul Callaghan, Pierre Courtieu, and Markus Wenzel,
Stefan Berghofer, Gerwin Klein, and other folk who tested pre-releases
or sent bug reports and patches, including Cuihtlauac Alvarado, Esben
Andreasen, Lennart Beringer, Pascal Brisset, James Brotherston, Martin
Buechi, Pierre Casteran, Lucas Dixon, Erik Martin-Dorel, Matt

1 Introducing Proof General
***************************

"Proof General" is a generic Emacs interface for interactive proof
assistants,(1) developed at the LFCS in the University of Edinburgh.

You do not have to be an Emacs militant to use Proof General!

The interface is designed to be very easy to use.  You develop your
proof script(2)  in-place rather than line-by-line and later
reassembling the pieces.  Proof General keeps track of which proof
steps have been processed by the prover, and prevents you editing them
accidently.  You can undo steps as usual.

The aim of Proof General is to provide a powerful and configurable
interface for numerous interactive proof assistants.  We target Proof
General mainly at intermediate or expert users, so that the interface
should be useful for large proof developments.

Please help us!

Send us comments, suggestsions, or (the best) patches to improve support
for your chosen proof assistant.  Contact us at
`http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/trac'.

If your chosen proof assistant isn't supported, read the accompanying
Adapting Proof General manual to find out how to configure PG for a new
prover.

---------- Footnotes ----------

(1) A "proof assistant" is a computerized helper for developing
mathematical proofs.  For short, we sometimes call it a "prover",
although we always have in mind an interactive system rather than a
fully automated theorem prover.

(2) A "proof script" is a sequence of commands  which constructs a
proof, usually stored in a file.


File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: Installing Proof General,  Next: Quick start guide,  Up: Introducing Proof General

1.1 Installing Proof General
============================

If Proof General has not already been installed for you, you should
unpack it and insert the line:
             (load "PROOF-GENERAL-HOME/generic/proof-site.el")
into your `~/.emacs' file, where PROOF-GENERAL-HOME is the top-level
directory that was created when Proof General was unpacked.

For much more information, *Note Obtaining and Installing::.


File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: Quick start guide,  Next: Features of Proof General,  Prev: Installing Proof General,  Up: Introducing Proof General

1.2 Quick start guide
=====================

Once Proof General is correctly installed, the corresponding Proof
General mode will be invoked automatically when you visit a proof
script file for your proof assistant, for example:

Prover                    Extensions             Mode
LEGO                      `.l'                   `lego-mode'
Coq                       `.v'                   `coq-mode'
Isabelle                  `.thy'                 `isar-mode'
Phox                      `.phx'                 `phox-mode'
HOL98                     `.sml'                 `hol98-mode'
HOL Light                 `.ml'                  `hol-light-mode'
ACL2                      `.acl2'                `acl2-mode'
Twelf                     `.elf'                 `twelf-mode'
Plastic                   `.lf'                  `plastic-mode'
Lambda-CLAM               `.lcm'                 `lclam-mode'
CCC                       `.ccc'                 `ccc-mode'
PG-Shell                  `.pgsh'                `pgshell-mode'
(the exact list of Proof Assistants supported may vary according to the
version of Proof General and its local configuration).  You can also
invoke the mode command directly, e.g., type `M-x lego-mode', to turn a
buffer into a lego script buffer.

You'll find commands to process the proof script are available from the
toolbar, menus, and keyboard.  Type `C-h m' to get a list of the
keyboard shortcuts for the current mode.  The commands available should
be easy to understand, but the rest of this manual describes them in
some detail.

The proof assistant itself is started automatically inside Emacs as an
"inferior" process when you ask for some of the proof script to be
processed.  You can start the proof assistant manually with the menu
command "Start proof assistant".

To follow an example use of Proof General on a Isabelle proof, *note
Walkthrough example in Isabelle::.  If you know the syntax for proof
scripts in another theorem prover, you can easily adapt the details
given there.

1.3 Features of Proof General
=============================

Why would you want to use Proof General?

Proof General is designed to be useful for novices and expert users
alike.  It will be useful to you if you use a proof assistant, and you'd
like an interface with the following features: simplified interaction,
script management, multiple file scripting, a script editing mode, proof
by pointing, proof-tree visualization, toolbar and menus, syntax
highlighting, real symbols, functions menu, tags, and finally,
adaptability.

Here is an outline of some of these features.   Look in the contents
page or index of this manual to find out about the others!

   * Simplified interaction
     Proof General is designed for proof assistants which have a
     command-line shell interpreter.  When using Proof General, the
     proof   assistant's shell is hidden from the user.  Communication
     takes   place via three buffers (Emacs text widgets).
     Communication takes place via three buffers.  The "script buffer"
     holds input, the commands to construct a proof.  The "goals
     buffer" displays the current list of subgoals to be solved.  The
     "response buffer" displays other output from the proof assistant.
     By default, only two of these three buffers are displayed.  This
     means that the user normally only sees the output from the most
     recent interaction, rather than a screen full of output from the
     proof assistant.

     Proof General does not commandeer the proof assistant shell: the
     user still has complete access to it if necessary.

     For more details, *note Summary of Proof General buffers:: and
     *note Display customization::.

   * Script management
     Proof General colours proof script regions blue when they have
     been processed by the prover, and colours regions red when the
     prover is currently processing them.  The appearance of Emacs
     buffers always matches the proof assistant's state. Coloured parts
     of the buffer cannot be edited.  Proof General has functions for
     _asserting_ or _retracting_ parts of a proof script, which alters
     the coloured regions.

     For more details, *note Basic Script Management::, *note Script
     processing commands::, and *note Advanced Script Management and
     Editing::.

   * Script editing mode
     Proof General provides useful facilities for editing proof scripts,
     including syntax hilighting and a menu to jump to particular goals,
     definitions, or declarations.  Special editing functions send
     lines of proof script to the proof assistant, or undo previous
     proof steps.

     For more details, *note Script editing commands::, and *note
     Script processing commands::.

   * Proof-tree visualization
     In cooperation with the external program Prooftree (available from
     the Prooftree website (http://askra.de/software/prooftree/)),
     Proof General can display proof trees graphically and provide
     visual information about the proof status of different branches in
     a proof. The proof-tree display provides additional means for
     inspecting the proof tree and thus helps against loosing track in
     proofs.

     The graphical proof-tree visualization is currently only supported
     for Coq. For more details, *note Graphical Proof-Tree
     Visualization::.

   * Toolbar and menus
     A script buffer has a toolbar with navigation buttons for
     processing parts of the proof script.  A menu provides further
     functions for operations in the proof assistant, as well as
     customization of Proof General.

     For more details, *note Toolbar commands::, *note Proof assistant
     commands::, and *note Customizing Proof General::.

   * Proof by pointing
     Proof General has support for proof-by-pointing and similar
     features.  Proof by pointing allows you to click on a subterm of a
     goal to be proved, and automatically apply an appropriate proof
     rule or tactic.  Proof by pointing is specific to the proof
     assistant (and logic) in use; therefore it is configured mainly on
     the proof assistant side.  If you would like to see proof by
     pointing support for Proof General in a particular proof
     assistant, petition the developers of the proof assistant to
     provide it.

1.4 Supported proof assistants
==============================

Proof General comes ready-customized for several proof assistants,
including these:

   * LEGO Proof General for LEGO Version 1.3.1
     *Note LEGO Proof General::, for more details.

   * Coq Proof General for Coq Version 8.2
     *Note Coq Proof General::, for more details.

   * Isabelle Proof General for Isabelle2009-2
     *Note Isabelle Proof General::, and documentation supplied with
     Isabelle for more details.

   * HOL Light Proof General for HOL Light
     *Note HOL Light Proof General::, for more details.

   * Shell Proof General for shell scripts (not really a proof
     assistant!)
     *Note Shell Proof General::, for more details.
Proof General is designed to be generic, so if you know how to write
regular expressions, you can make:
   * Your Proof General for your favourite proof assistant.
     For more details of how to make Proof General work with another
     proof assistant, see the accompanying manual Adapting Proof
     General.
The exact list of Proof Assistants supported may vary according to the
version of Proof General you have and its local configuration; only the
standard instances documented in this manual are listed above.

Note that there is some variation between the features supported by
different instances of Proof General.  The main variation is proof by
pointing, which is only supported in LEGO at the moment.  For advanced
features like this, some extensions to the output routines of the proof
assistant are required, typically.  If you like Proof General, please
help us by asking the implementors of your favourite proof assistant to
support Proof General as much as possible.


File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: Prerequisites for this manual,  Next: Organization of this manual,  Prev: Supported proof assistants,  Up: Introducing Proof General

1.5 Prerequisites for this manual
=================================

This manual assumes that you understand a little about using Emacs, for
example, switching between buffers using `C-x b' and understanding that
a key sequence like `C-x b' means "control with x, followed by b".  A
key sequence like `M-z' means "meta with z".  (<Meta> may be labelled
<Alt> on your keyboard).

The manual also assumes you have a basic understanding of your proof
assistant and the language and files it uses for proof scripts.  But
even without this, Proof General is not useless: you can use the
interface to _replay_ proof scripts for any proof assistant without
knowing how to start it up or issue commands, etc.  This is the beauty
of a common interface mechanism.

To get more from Proof General and adapt it to your liking, it helps to
know a little bit about how Emacs lisp packages can be customized via
the Customization mechanism.  It's really easy to use.  For details,
*note How to customize::.  *note ((emacs))Customization::, for
documentation in Emacs.

To get the absolute most from Proof General, to improve it or to adapt
it for new provers, you'll need to know a little bit of Emacs lisp.
Emacs is self-documenting, so you can begin from `C-h' and find out
everything!  Here are some useful commands:

`C-h i'
     `info'

`C-h m'
     `describe-mode'

`C-h b'
     `describe-bindings'

`C-h f'
     `describe-function'

`C-h v'
     `describe-variable'

1.6 Organization of this manual
===============================

This manual covers the user-level view and customization of Proof
General.  The accompanying Adapting Proof General manual considers
adapting Proof General to new proof assistants, and documents some of
the internals of Proof General.

Three appendices of this manual contain some details about obtaining and
installing Proof General and some known bugs.  The contents of these
final chapters is also covered in the files `INSTALL' and `BUGS'
contained in the distribution.  Refer to those files for the latest
information.

The manual concludes with some references and indexes.  See the table of
contents for full details.

2 Basic Script Management
*************************

This chapter is an introduction to using the script management
facilities of Proof General.  We begin with a quick walkthrough example,
then describe the concepts and functions in more detail.

File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: Walkthrough example in Isabelle,  Next: Proof scripts,  Up: Basic Script Management

2.1 Walkthrough example in Isabelle
===================================

Here's a short example in Isabelle to see how script management is
used.  The file you are asked to type below is included in the
distribution as `isar/Example.thy'.  If you're not using Isabelle,
substitute some lines from a simple proof for your proof assistant, or
consult the example file supplied with Proof General for your prover,
called something like `foo/example.foo' for a proof assistant Foo.

This walkthrough is keyboard based, but you could easily use the toolbar
and menu functions instead.  The best way to learn Emacs key bindings is
by using the menus.  You'll find the keys named below listed on the
menus.

   * First, start Emacs with Proof General loaded.  According to how you
     have installed Proof General, this may be by typing
     `proofgeneral', selecting it from a menu, or simply by starting
     Emacs itself.

   * Next, find a new file by `C-x C-f' and typing as the filename
     `Walkthrough.thy'.  This should load Isabelle Proof General and the
     toolbar and Proof General menus will appear.  You should have an
     empty buffer displayed.

The notation `C-x C-f' means control key with `x' followed by control
key with `f'.  This is a standard notation for Emacs key bindings, used
throughout this manual.  This function also appears on the `File' menu
of Emacs.  The remaining commands used will be on the `Proof-General'
menu or toolbar.

If you're not using Isabelle, you must choose a different file
extension, appropriately for your proof assistant.  If you don't know
what to use, see the previous chapter for the list of supported
assistants and file extensions.

   * Turn on "electric terminator" by typing `C-c ;' and enter:
          theory Walkthrough imports Main begin;
     This first command begins the definition of a new theory inside
     Isabelle, which extends the theory `Main'.  (We're assuming that
     you have Isabelle/HOL available, which declares the `Main' theory.
     You should be able to see the list of installed logics in Isabelle
     on the `Logics' menu).

Electric terminator sends commands to the proof assistant as you type
them.  At the moment you type the semicolon, the `theory' command will
be sent to Isabelle behind the scenes.  First, there is a short delay
while Isabelle is launched; you may see a welcome message.  Then, you
may notice that the command briefly is given an orange/pink background
(or shown in inverse video if you don't have a colour display), before
you see a window containing text like this:
     theory Walkthrough
which reflects the command just executed.

In this case of this first command, it is hard to see the orange/pink
stage because the command is processed very quickly on modern machines.
But in general, processing commands can take an arbitrary amount of time
(or not terminate at all).  For this reason, Proof General maintains a
queue of commands which are sent one-by-one from the proof script.  As
Isabelle successfully processes commands in the queue, they will turn
from the orange/pink colour into blue.

The blue regions indicate text that has been read by the prover and
should not be edited, to avoid confusion between what the prover has
processed and what you are looking at.  To enforce this (and avoid
potentially expensive reprocessing) the blue region can be made
read-only.  This is controlled by the menu item:
       Proof-General -> Quick Options -> Read Only
The first option `Strict Read Only' was formerly the default for Proof
General, and causes the blue region to be locked.  Because of this, the
term "locked region" term is used in Proof General documentation to
mean the blue portion of the text which has been processed, although it
is no longer locked by default.  The current default is `Undo on Edit'
which causes the prover to undo back to any user edits.  So if you
change a processed piece of text you will need to re-process it.  The
final option, `Freely Edit', allows you to freely edit the buffer
without causing the prover to reprocess it.  This can quickly lead to
confusion and a loss of synchronization between what you are reading and
what the prover has processed, so it is best used sparingly.

Electric terminator mode is popular, but not enabled by default because
of the principle of least surprise.  Moreover, in Isabelle, the
semicolon terminators are optional so proof scripts are usually written
without them to avoid clutter.  You'll notice that although you typed a
semi-colon it was not included in the buffer!  The electric terminator
tries to be smart about comments and strings but sometimes it may be
confused (e.g., adding a semi-colon inside an already written comment),
or you may need to type several terminator commands together.  In this
case you can use the standard Emacs quote next character, typing `C-q
;' to quote the semi-colon.  Alternatively you can use a prefix
argument, as in `M-3 ;' to type three semi-colons.

Without using electric terminator, you can trigger processing the text
up to the current position of the point with the key `C-c C-RET', or
just up to the next command with `C-c C-n'.  We show the rest of the
example in Isabelle with semi-colons, but these will not appear in the
final text.

Coq, on the other hand, requires a full-stop terminator at the end of
each line, so `C-c C-.' is the key binding used to turn on electric
terminator.  If you don't know what the terminator character is, you
can find the option anyway on the menu: `Proof-General -> Quick Options
-> Processing -> Electric Terminator' which also shows the key binding.

If you want to use electric terminator, you can customize Proof General
to enable it everytime if you want, *Note Customizing Proof General::.
For the common options, customization is easy: just use the menu item
`Proof General -> Quick Options' to make your choices, and
`Proof-General -> Quick Options -> Save Options' to save your choices.

   * Next type on a new line:
          theorem my_theorem: "A & B --> B & A";

The goal we have set ourselves to prove should be displayed in the
goals buffer.

   * Now type:
          proof
            assume "A & C";
This will update the goals buffer.

But whoops!  That was the wrong command, we typed `C' instead of `B'.

   * Press `C-c C-BS' to pretend that didn't happen.
Note: `BS' means the backspace key.  This key press sends an undo
command to Isabelle, and deletes the `assume' command from the proof
script.  If you just want to undo without deleting, you can type `C-c
C-u' instead, or use the left-arrow toolbar navigation button.

   * Instead, let's try:
            assume "A & B";
     Which is better.

   * From this assumption we can get `B' and `A' by the trivial step
     `..' which splits the assumption using an elimination step:
            then obtain B and A ..;

   * Finally, we establish the goal by the trivial step `..' again,
     which triggers an introduction rule:
            then show "B & A" ..;

After this proof step, the message from Isabelle indicates that the
proof has succeeded, so we can conclude the proof with the `qed'
command.

   * Finally, type:
          qed;

This last command closes the proof and saves the proved theorem.

Moving the mouse pointer over the qed command now reveals that the
entire proof has been aggregated into a single segment (if you did this
before, you would see highlighting of each command separately).

   * Suppose we decide to call the theorem something more sensible.
     Move the cursor up into the locked region, somewhere between
     `theorem' and `qed', enter `C-c C-RET'.

You see that the locked segment for the whole proof is now unlocked (and
uncoloured): it is transferred back into the editing region.

The command `C-c C-RET' moves the end of the locked region to the
cursor position, or as near as possible above or below it, sending
undoing commands or proof commands as necessary.  In this case, the
locked region will always be moved back to the end of the `theory'
line, since that is the closest possible position to the cursor that
appears before it.  If you simply want to retract the whole file in one
go, you can use the key `C-c C-r' (which corresponds to the up arrow on
the toolbar), which will automatically move the cursor to the top of
the file.

   * Now improve the goal name, for example:
          theorem and_commutes: "A & B --> B & A"
     You can swiftly replay the rest of the buffer now with `C-c C-b'
     (or the down arrow on the toolbar).

   * At the end of the buffer, you may insert the command
          end
     to complete the theory.

Notice that if you right-click on one of the highlighted regions in the
blue area you will see a context menu for the region.  This includes a
"show/hide" option for folding a proof, as well as some editing
commands for copying the region or rearranging its order in the
processed text: "move up/move down". (These latter commands
occasionally help you reorder text without needing to reprove it,
although they risk breaking the proof!)

Finally, once you are happy with your theory, you should save the file
with `C-x C-s' before moving on to edit another file or exiting Emacs.
If you forget to do this, Proof General or Emacs will surely prompt you
sooner or later!

2.2 Proof scripts
=================

A "proof script" is a sequence of commands which constructs
definitions, declarations, theories, and proofs in a proof assistant.
Proof General is designed to work with text-based interactive proof
assistants, where the mode of working is usually a dialogue between the
human and the proof assistant.

Primitive interfaces for proof assistants simply present a "shell"
(command interpreter) view of this dialogue: the human repeatedly types
commands to the shell until the proof is completed.  The system responds
at each step, perhaps with a new list of subgoals to be solved, or
perhaps with a failure report.  Proof General manages the dialogue to
show the human only the information which is relevant at each step.

Often we want to keep a record of the proof commands used to prove a
theorem, to build up a library of proved results.  An easy way to store
a proof is to keep a text file which contains a proof script; proof
assistants usually provide facilities to read a proof script from a file
instead of the terminal.  Using the file, we can "replay" the proof
script to prove the theorem again.

Using only a primitive shell interface, it can be tedious to construct
proof scripts with cut-and-paste.  Proof General helps out by issuing
commands directly from a proof script file, while it is being written
and edited.  Proof General can also be used conveniently to replay a
proof step-by-step, to see the progress at each stage.

"Scripting" is the process of building up a proof script file or
replaying a proof.  When scripting, Proof General sends proof commands
to the proof assistant one at a time, and prevents you from editing
commands which have been successfully completed by the proof assistant,
to keep synchronization.  Regions of the proof script are analysed
based on their syntax and the behaviour of the proof assistant after
each proof command.

2.3 Script buffers
==================

A "script buffer" is a buffer displaying a proof script.  Its Emacs
mode is particular to the proof assistant you are using (but it inherits
from "proof-mode").

A script buffer is divided into three regions: _locked_, _queue_ and
_editing_.  The proof commands in the script buffer can include a
number of _Goal-save sequences_.

* Menu:

* Locked queue and editing regions::
* Goal-save sequences::
* Active scripting buffer::


File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: Locked queue and editing regions,  Next: Goal-save sequences,  Up: Script buffers

2.3.1 Locked, queue, and editing regions
----------------------------------------

The three regions that a script buffer is divided into are:
   * The _locked_ region, which appears in blue (underlined on
     monochrome displays) and contains commands which have been sent to
     the proof process and verified. The commands in the locked region
     cannot be edited.

   * The _queue_ region, which appears in pink (inverse video) and
     contains commands waiting to be sent to the proof process. Like
     those in the locked region, these commands can't be edited.

   * The _editing_ region, which contains the commands the user is
     working on, and can be edited as normal Emacs text.

These three regions appear in the buffer in the order above; that is,
the locked region is always at the start of the buffer, and the editing
region always at the end. The queue region only exists if there is input
waiting to be processed by the proof process.

Proof General has two fundamental operations which transfer commands
between these regions: _assertion_ (or processing) and _retraction_ (or
undoing).

*Assertion* causes commands from the editing region to be transferred
to the queue region and sent one by one to the proof process. If the
command is accepted, it is transferred to the locked region, but if an
error occurs it is signalled to the user, and the offending command is
transferred back to the editing region together with any remaining
commands in the queue.

Assertion corresponds to processing proof commands, and makes the locked
region grow.

*Retraction* causes commands to be transferred from the locked region
to the editing region (again via the queue region) and the appropriate
'undo' commands to be sent to the proof process.

Retraction corresponds to undoing commands, and makes the locked region
shrink.  For details of the commands available for doing assertion and
retraction, *Note Script processing commands::.


File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: Goal-save sequences,  Next: Active scripting buffer,  Prev: Locked queue and editing regions,  Up: Script buffers

2.3.2 Goal-save sequences
-------------------------

A proof script contains a sequence of commands used to prove one or more
theorems.

As commands in a proof script are transferred to the locked region, they
are aggregated into segments which constitute the smallest units which
can be undone. Typically a segment consists of a declaration or
definition, or all the text from a "goal" command to the corresponding
"save" (e.g. `qed') command, or the individual commands in the proof of
an unfinished goal.  As the mouse moves over the the region, the
segment containing the pointer will be highlighted.

Proof General therefore assumes that the proof script has a series of
proofs which look something like this:
        goal MYTHM is G
        ...
        save theorem MYTHM
interspersed with comments, definitions, and the like.  Of course, the
exact syntax and terminology will depend on the proof assistant you use.

The name MYTHM can appear in a menu for the proof script to help
quickly find a proof (*note Imenu and Speedbar::).


File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: Active scripting buffer,  Prev: Goal-save sequences,  Up: Script buffers

2.3.3 Active scripting buffer
-----------------------------

You can edit as many script buffers as you want simultaneously, but only
one buffer at a time can be used to process a proof script
incrementally: this is the "active scripting buffer".

The active scripting buffer has a special indicator: the word
`Scripting' appears in its mode line at the bottom of the screen.  This
is coloured to indicate the status: if it has a pink or blue
background, the prover is processing the text (busy when pink).  If it
is in green, the buffer is completely processed.

When you use a scripting command, it will automatically turn a buffer
into the active scripting mode.  You can also do this by hand, via the
menu command 'Toggle Scripting' or the key `C-c C-s'.

`C-c C-s'
     `proof-toggle-active-scripting'

When active scripting mode is turned on, several things may happen to
get ready for scripting (exactly what happens depends on which proof
assistant you are using and some user settings).  First, the proof
assistant is started if it is not already running.  Second, a command is
sent to the proof assistant to change directory to the directory of the
current buffer.  If the current buffer corresponds to a file, this is
the directory the file lives in.  This is in case any scripting commands
refer to files in the same directory as the script.  The third thing
that may happen is that you are prompted to save some unsaved buffers.
This is in case any scripting commands may read in files which you are
editing.  Finally, some proof assistants may automatically read in
files which the current file depends on implicitly.  In Isabelle, for
example, there is an implicit dependency between a `.ML' script file
and a `.thy' theory file which defines its theory.

If you have a partly processed scripting buffer and use `C-c C-s', or
you attempt to use script processing in a new buffer, Proof General
will ask you if you want to retract what has been proved so far,
`Scripting incomplete in buffer myproof.l, retract?' or if you want to
process the remainder of the active buffer, `Completely process buffer
myproof.l instead?' before you can start scripting in a new buffer.  If
you refuse to do either, Proof General will give an error message:
`Cannot have more than one active scripting buffer!'.

To turn off active scripting, the buffer must be completely processed
(all blue), or completely unprocessed.  There are two reasons for this.
First, it would certainly be confusing if it were possible to split
parts of a proof arbitrarily between different buffers; the dependency
between the commands would be lost and it would be tricky to replay the
proof.(1)  Second, we want to interface with file management in the
proof assistant.  Proof General assumes that a proof assistant may have
a notion of which files have been processed, but that it will only
record files that have been completely processed.  For more explanation
of the handling of multiple files, *Note Switching between proof
scripts::.

 -- Command: proof-toggle-active-scripting &optional arg
     Toggle active scripting mode in the current buffer.
     With ARG, turn on scripting iff ARG is positive.

---------- Footnotes ----------

(1) Some proof assistants provide some level of support for switching
between multiple concurrent proofs, but Proof General does not use
this.  Generally the exact context for such proofs is hard to define to
easily split them into multiple files.

2.4 Summary of Proof General buffers
====================================

Proof General manages several kinds of buffers in Emacs.  Here is a
summary of the different kinds of buffers you will use when developing
proofs.

   * The "proof shell buffer" is an Emacs shell buffer  used to run
     your proof assistant.  Usually it is hidden from view  (but *note
     Escaping script management::).   Communication with the proof
     shell takes place via two or three  intermediate buffers.

   * A "script buffer", as we have explained, is a buffer for editing a
     proof script.  The "active scripting buffer" is the script buffer
     which is currently being used to send commands to the proof shell.

   * The "goals buffer" displays the list of subgoals to be  solved for
     a proof in progress.  During a proof it is usually  displayed
     together with the script buffer.   The goals buffer has facility
     for "proof-by-pointing".

   * The "response buffer" displays other output from the proof
     assistant, for example error messages or informative messages.
     The response buffer is displayed whenever Proof General puts  a
     new message in it.

   * The "trace buffer" is a special version of the response  buffer.
     It may be used to display unusual debugging output from the
     prover, for example, tracing proof tactics or rewriting procedures.
     This buffer is also displayed whenever Proof General puts a new
     message  in it (although it may be quickly replaced with the
     response or goals  buffer in two-buffer mode).

Normally Proof General will automatically reveal and hide the goals and
response buffers as necessary during scripting.  However there are ways
to customize the way the buffers are displayed, for example, to prevent
auxiliary buffers being displayed at all (*note Display
customization::).

The menu `Proof General -> Buffers' provides a convenient way to
display or switch to a Proof General buffer: the active scripting
buffer; the goal or response buffer; the tracing buffer; or the shell
buffer.  Another command on this menu, `Clear Responses', clears the
response and tracing buffer.


File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: Script editing commands,  Next: Script processing commands,  Prev: Summary of Proof General buffers,  Up: Basic Script Management

2.5 Script editing commands
===========================

Proof General provides a few functions for editing proof scripts.  The
generic functions mainly consist of commands to navigate within the
script.  Specific proof assistant code may add more to these basics.

Indentation is controlled by the user option `proof-script-indent'
(*note User options::).  When indentation is enabled, Proof General
will indent lines of proof script with the usual Emacs functions,
particularly `TAB', `indent-for-tab-command'.  Unfortunately,
indentation in Proof General 4.2pre is somewhat slow.  Therefore with
large proof scripts, we recommend `proof-script-indent' is turned off.

Here are the commands for moving around in a proof script, with their
default key-bindings: 
`C-c C-a'
     `proof-goto-command-start'

`C-c C-e'
     `proof-goto-command-end'

`C-c C-.'
     `proof-goto-end-of-locked'

 -- Command: proof-goto-command-start
     Move point to start of current (or final) command of the script.

 -- Command: proof-goto-command-end
     Set point to end of command at point.

The variable `proof-terminal-string' is a prover-specific string to
terminate proof commands.  LEGO and Isabelle use a semicolon, `;'. Coq
employs a full-stop `.'.

 -- Command: proof-goto-end-of-locked &optional switch
     Jump to the end of the locked region, maybe switching to script
     buffer.
     If called interactively or SWITCH is non-nil, switch to script
     buffer.  If called interactively, a mark is set at the current
     location with ``push-mark''


File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: Script processing commands,  Next: Proof assistant commands,  Prev: Script editing commands,  Up: Basic Script Management

2.6 Script processing commands
==============================

Here are the commands for asserting and retracting portions of the proof
script, together with their default key-bindings.  Sometimes assertion
and retraction commands can only be issued when the queue is empty.  You
will get an error message `Proof Process Busy!' if you try to assert or
retract when the queue is being processed.(1)

`C-c C-n'
     `proof-assert-next-command-interactive'

`C-c C-u'
     `proof-undo-last-successful-command'

`C-c C-BS'
     `proof-undo-and-delete-successful-command'

`C-c C-RET'
     `proof-goto-point'

`C-c C-b'
     `proof-process-buffer'

`C-c C-r'
     `proof-retract-buffer'

`C-c TERMINATOR-CHARACTER'
     `proof-electric-terminator-toggle'

The last command, `proof-electric-terminator-toggle', is triggered
using the character which terminates proof commands for your proof
assistant's script language.  For LEGO and Isabelle, use `C-c ;', for
Coq, use `C-c .'.  This not really a script processing command.
Instead, if enabled, it causes subsequent key presses of `;' or `.' to
automatically activate `proof-assert-next-command-interactive' for
convenience.

Rather than use a file command inside the proof assistant to read a
proof script, a good reason to use `C-c C-b' (`proof-process-buffer')
is that with a faulty proof script (e.g., a script you are adapting to
prove a different theorem), Proof General will stop exactly where the
proof script fails, showing you the error message and the last
processed command.  So you can easily continue development from exactly
the right place in the script.

Here is the full set of script processing commands.

 -- Command: proof-assert-next-command-interactive
     Process until the end of the next unprocessed command after point.
     If inside a comment, just process until the start of the comment.

 -- Command: proof-undo-last-successful-command
     Undo last successful command at end of locked region.

 -- Command: proof-undo-and-delete-last-successful-command
     Undo and delete last successful command at end of locked region.
     Useful if you typed completely the wrong command.  Also handy for
     proof by pointing, in case the last proof-by-pointing command took
     the proof in a direction you don't like.

     Notice that the deleted command is put into the Emacs kill ring, so
     you can use the usual `yank' and similar commands to retrieve the
     deleted text.

 -- Command: proof-goto-point
     Assert or retract to the command at current position.
     Calls ``proof-assert-until-point'' or
     ``proof-retract-until-point'' as appropriate.

 -- Command: proof-process-buffer
     Process the current (or script) buffer, and maybe move point to
     the end.

 -- Command: proof-retract-buffer &optional called-interactively
     Retract the current buffer, and maybe move point to the start.
     Point is only moved according to ``proof-follow-mode'', if
     CALLED-INTERACTIVELY is non-nil, which is the case for all
     interactive calls.

 -- Command: proof-electric-terminator-toggle &optional arg
     Toggle ``proof-electric-terminator-enable''. With ARG, turn on iff
     ARG>0.
     This function simply uses `customize-set-variable' to set the
     variable.

 -- Command: proof-assert-until-point-interactive
     Process the region from the end of the locked-region until point.
     If inside a comment, just process until the start of the comment.

 -- Command: proof-retract-until-point-interactive &optional
          delete-region
     Tell the proof process to retract until point.
     If invoked outside a locked region, undo the last successfully
     processed command.  If called with a prefix argument
     (DELETE-REGION non-nil), also delete the retracted region from the
     proof-script.

As experienced Emacs users will know, a prefix argument is a numeric
argument supplied by some key sequence typed before a command key
sequence.  You can supply a specific number by typing <Meta> with the
digits, or a "universal" prefix of `C-u'.  See *note
((emacs))Arguments:: for more details.  Several Proof General commands,
like `proof-retract-until-point-interactive', may accept a prefix
argument to adjust their behaviour somehow.

---------- Footnotes ----------

(1) In fact, this is an unnecessary restriction imposed by the original
design of Proof General.  There is nothing to stop future versions of
Proof General allowing the queue region to be extended or shrunk,
whilst the prover is processing it.  Proof General 3.0 already relaxes
the original design, by allowing successive assertion commands without
complaining.


File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: Proof assistant commands,  Next: Toolbar commands,  Prev: Script processing commands,  Up: Basic Script Management

2.7 Proof assistant commands
============================

There are several commands for interacting with the proof assistant and
Proof General, which do not involve the proof script.  Here are the
key-bindings and functions.

`C-c C-l'
     `proof-display-some-buffers'

`C-c C-p'
     `proof-prf'

`C-c C-t'
     `proof-ctxt'

`C-c C-h'
     `proof-help'

`C-c C-i'
     `proof-query-identifier'

`C-c C-f'
     `proof-find-theorems'

`C-c C-w'
     `pg-response-clear-displays'

`C-c C-c'
     `proof-interrupt-process'

`C-c C-v'
     `proof-minibuffer-cmd'

`C-c C-s'
     `proof-shell-start'

`C-c C-x'
     `proof-shell-exit'

 -- Command: proof-display-some-buffers
     Display the reponse, trace, goals, or shell buffer, rotating.
     A fixed number of repetitions of this command switches back to the
     same buffer.  Also move point to the end of the response buffer if
     it's selected.  If in three window or multiple frame mode, display
     two buffers.  The idea of this function is to change the
     window->buffer mapping without adjusting window layout.

 -- Command: proof-prf
     Show the current proof state.
     Issues a command to the assistant based on
     `proof-showproof-command'.

 -- Command: proof-ctxt
     Show the current context.
     Issues a command to the assistant based on `proof-context-command'.

 -- Command: proof-help
     Show a help or information message from the proof assistant.
     Typically, a list of syntax of commands available.  Issues a
     command to the assistant based on `proof-info-command'.

 -- Command: proof-query-identifier string
     Query the prover about the identifier STRING.
     If called interactively, STRING defaults to the current word near
     point.

 -- Command: proof-find-theorems arg
     Search for items containing given constants.
     Issues a command based on ARG to the assistant, using
     `proof-find-theorems-command'.  The user is prompted for an
     argument.

 -- Command: pg-response-clear-displays
     Clear Proof General response and tracing buffers.
     You can use this command to clear the output from these buffers
     when it becomes overly long.  Particularly useful when
     ``proof-tidy-response'' is set to nil, so responses are not
     cleared automatically.

 -- Command: proof-interrupt-process
     Interrupt the proof assistant.  Warning! This may confuse Proof
     General.

     This sends an interrupt signal to the proof assistant, if Proof
     General thinks it is busy.

     This command is risky because we don't know whether the last
     command succeeded or not.  The assumption is that it didn't, which
     should be true most of the time, and all of the time if the proof
     assistant has a careful handling of interrupt signals.

     Some provers may ignore (and lose) interrupt signals, or fail to
     indicate that they have been acted upon yet stop in the middle of
     output.  In the first case, PG will terminate the queue of
     commands at the first available point.  In the second case, you
     may need to press enter inside the prover command buffer (e.g.,
     with Isabelle2009 press RET inside *isabelle*).

 -- Command: proof-minibuffer-cmd cmd
     Send CMD to proof assistant.  Interactively, read from minibuffer.
     The command isn't added to the locked region.

     If a prefix arg is given and there is a selected region, that is
     pasted into the command.  This is handy for copying terms, etc from
     the script.

     If ``proof-strict-state-preserving'' is set, and
     ``proof-state-preserving-p'' is configured, then the latter is
     used as a check that the command will be safe to execute, in other
     words, that it won't ruin synchronization.  If when applied to the
     command it returns false, then an error message is given.

     WARNING: this command risks spoiling synchronization if the test
     ``proof-state-preserving-p'' is not configured, if it is only an
     approximate test, or if ``proof-strict-state-preserving'' is off
     (nil).

As if the last two commands weren't risky enough, there's also a command
which explicitly adjusts the end of the locked region, to be used in
extreme circumstances only.  *Note Escaping script management::.

There are a few commands for starting, stopping, and restarting the
proof assistant process.  The first two have key bindings but restart
does not.  As with any Emacs command, you can invoke these with `M-x'
followed by the command name.

 -- Command: proof-shell-start
     Initialise a shell-like buffer for a proof assistant.
     Does nothing if proof assistant is already running.

     Also generates goal and response buffers.

     If ``proof-prog-name-ask'' is set, query the user for the process
     command.

 -- Command: proof-shell-exit &optional dont-ask
     Query the user and exit the proof process.

     This simply kills the ``proof-shell-buffer'' relying on the hook
     function

     ``proof-shell-kill-function'' to do the hard work. If optional
     argument DONT-ASK is non-nil, the proof process is terminated
     without confirmation.

     The kill function uses `<PA>-quit-timeout' as a timeout to wait
     after sending ``proof-shell-quit-cmd'' before rudely killing the
     process.

     This function should not be called if
     ``proof-shell-exit-in-progress'' is t, because a recursive call of
     ``proof-shell-kill-function'' will give strange errors.

 -- Command: proof-shell-restart
     Clear script buffers and send ``proof-shell-restart-cmd''.
     All locked regions are cleared and the active scripting buffer
     deactivated.

     If the proof shell is busy, an interrupt is sent with
     ``proof-interrupt-process'' and we wait until the process is ready.

     The restart command should re-synchronize Proof General with the
     proof assistant, without actually exiting and restarting the proof
     assistant process.

     It is up to the proof assistant how much context is cleared: for
     example, theories already loaded may be "cached" in some way, so
     that loading them the next time round only performs a re-linking
     operation, not full re-processing.  (One way of caching is via
     object files, used by Lego and Coq).

2.8 Toolbar commands
====================

The toolbar provides a selection of functions for asserting and
retracting portions of the script, issuing non-scripting commands to
inspect the prover's state, and inserting "goal" and "save" type
commands.  The latter functions are not available on keys, but are
available from the from the menu, or via `M-x', as well as the toolbar.

 -- Command: proof-issue-goal arg
     Write a goal command in the script, prompting for the goal.
     Issues a command based on ARG to the assistant, using
     `proof-goal-command'.  The user is prompted for an argument.

 -- Command: proof-issue-save arg
     Write a save/qed command in the script, prompting for the theorem
     name.
     Issues a command based on ARG to the assistant, using
     `proof-save-command'.  The user is prompted for an argument.

2.9 Interrupting during trace output
====================================

If your prover generates output which is recognized as tracing output in
Proof General, you may need to know about a special provision for
interrupting the prover process.  If the trace output is voluminous,
perhaps looping, it may be difficult to interrupt with the ordinary
`C-c C-c' (`proof-interrupt-process') or the corresponding button/menu.
In this case, you should try Emacs's quit key, `C-g'.  This will cause
a quit in any current editing commands, as usual, but during tracing
output it will also send an interrupt signal to the prover.  Hopefully
this will stop the tracing output, and Emacs should catch up after a
short delay.

Here's an explanation of the reason for this special provision.  When
large volumes of output from the prover arrive quickly in Emacs, as
typically is the case during tracing (especially tracing looping
tactics!), Emacs may hog the CPU and spend all its time updating the
display with the trace output.  This is especially the case when
features like output fontification and token display are active.  If
this happens, ordinary user input in Emacs is not processed, and it
becomes difficult to do normal editing.  The root of the problem is that
Emacs runs in a single thread, and pending process output is dealt with
before pending user input.  Whether or not you see this problem depends
partly on the processing power of your machine (or CPU available to
Emacs when the prover is running).  One way to test is to start an Emacs
shell with `M-x shell' and type a command such as `yes' which produces
output indefinitely.  Now see if you can interrupt the process!
(Warning -- on slower machines especially, this can cause lockups, so
use a fresh Emacs.)

3 Advanced Script Management and Editing
****************************************

If you are working with large proof developments, you may want to know

File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: Document centred working,  Next: Automatic processing,  Up: Advanced Script Management and Editing

3.1 Document centred working
============================

Proof scripts can be annotated with the output produced by the prover
while they are checked.  By hovering the mouse on the completed regions
you can see any output that was produced when they were checked.
Depending on the proof language (it works well with declarative
languages), this may enable a "document centred" way of working, where
you may not need to keep a separate window open for displaying prover
output.

This way of working is controlled by several settings.  To help
configure things appropriately for document-centred working, there are
two short-cut commands:
     Proof-General -> Quick Options -> Display -> Document Centred
     Proof-General -> Quick Options -> Display -> Default
which change settings appropriately between a document centred mode and
the original classic Proof General behaviour and appearance.  The first
command also engages automatic processing of the whole buffer,
explained in the following section further below.

The behaviour can be fine-tuned with the individual settings.  Starting
with the classic settings, first, you may select
     Proof-General -> Quick Options -> Processing -> Full Annotations
to ensure that the details are recorded in the script.  This is not the
default because it can cause long sequences of commands to execute more
slowly as the output is collected from the prover eagerly when the
commands are executed, and printing can be be slow for large and complex
expressions.  It also increases the space requirements for Emacs
buffers.  However, when interactively developing smaller files, it is
very useful.

Next, you may deselect
     Proof-General -> Quick Options -> Display -> Auto Raise
which will prevent the prover output being eagerly displayed.  You can
still manually arrange your Emacs windows and frames to ensure the
output buffers are present if you want.

You may like to deselect
     Proof General -> Quick Options -> Display -> Colour Locked
to prevent highlighting of the locked region.  This text which has been
checked and that which has not is less obvious, but you can see the
position of the next command to be processed with the marker.

If you have no colouring on the locked region, it can be hard to see
where processing has got to.  Look for the "overlay marker", a triangle
in the left-hand fringe of the display, to see which line processing has
stopped at.   If it has stopped on a region with an error, you might
want to see that.  You can select
     Proof-General -> Quick Options -> Display -> Sticky Errors
to add a higlight for regions which did not successfully process on the
last attempt.  Whenever the region is edited, the highlight is removed.

Finally, you may want to ensure that
     Proof-General -> Quick Options -> Read Only -> Undo On Edit
is selected.  Undo on edit is a setting for the
`proof-strict-read-only' variable.  This allows you to freely edit the
processed region, but first it automatically retracts back to the point
of the edit.  Comments can be edited freely without retraction.

The configuration variables controlled by the above menu items can be
customized as Emacs variables.  The two settings which control
interaction with the prover are `proof-full-annotation' and
`proof-strict-read-only'.  Note that you can also record the history of
output from the prover without adding mouse hovers to the script.  This
is controlled by `proof-output-tooltips' which is also on the Display
menu in Quick Options.  *Note Display customization::, for more
information about customizing display options.

 -- User Option: proof-full-annotation
     Non-nil causes Proof General to record output for all proof
     commands.
     Proof output is recorded as it occurs interactively; normally if
     many steps are taken at once, this output is suppressed.  If this
     setting is used to enable it, the proof script can be annotated
     with full details.  See also ``proof-output-tooltips'' to enable
     automatic display of output on mouse hovers.

     The default value is `nil'.

 -- User Option: proof-strict-read-only
     Whether Proof General is strict about the read-only region in
     buffers.
     If non-nil, an error is given when an attempt is made to edit the
     read-only region, except for the special value `'retract' which
     means undo first.  If nil, Proof General is more relaxed (but may
     give you a reprimand!).

     The default value is `retract'.

3.2 Automatic processing
========================

If you like making your hair stand on end, the electric terminator mode
is probably not enough.  Proof General has another feature that will
automatically send text to the prover, while you aren't looking.

Enabling
     Proof-General -> Quick Options -> Processing -> Process Automatically

Causes Proof General to start processing text when Emacs is idle for a
while.  You can choose either to send just the next command beyond the
point, or the whole buffer.  See
     Proof-General -> Quick Options -> Processing -> Automatic Processing Mode
for the choices.

The text will be sent in a fast loop that processes more quickly than
`C-c C-b' (i.e., `proof-process-buffer', the down toolbar button), but
ignores user input and doesn't update the display.  But the feature
tries to be non-intrusive to the user: if you start to type something
or use the mouse, the fast loop will be interrupted and revert to a
slower interactive loop with display updates.

In the check next command mode, the successfully checked region will
briefly flash up as green to indicate it is okay.

You can use `C-c C-.' (`proof-goto-end-of-locked') to find out where
processing got to, as usual.  Text is only sent if the last interactive
command processed some text (i.e., wasn't an undo step backwards into
the buffer) and processing didn't stop with an error.  To start
automatic processing again after an error, simply hit `C-c C-n' after
editing the buffer.  To turn the automatic processing on or off from
the keyboard, you can use the keybinding:

`C-c >'
     `proof-autosend-toggle'

 -- Command: proof-autosend-toggle &optional arg
     Toggle ``proof-autosend-enable''. With ARG, turn on iff ARG>0.
     This function simply uses `customize-set-variable' to set the
     variable.


File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: Visibility of completed proofs,  Next: Switching between proof scripts,  Prev: Automatic processing,  Up: Advanced Script Management and Editing

3.3 Visibility of completed proofs
==================================

Large developments may consist of large files with many proofs.  To help
see what has been proved without the detail of the proof itself, Proof
General can hide portions of the proof script.  Two different kinds of
thing can be hidden: comments and (what Proof General designates as) the
body of proofs.

You can toggle the visibility of a proof script portion by using the
context sensitive menu triggered by clicking the right mouse button on
a completed proof, or the key `C-c v', which runs
`pg-toggle-visibility'.

You can also select the "disappearing proofs" mode from the menu,
       Proof-General -> Quick Options -> Display -> Disappearing Proofs
This automatically hides each the body of each proof portion as it is
completed by the proof assistant.  Two further menu commands in the
main Proof-General menu, _Show all_ and _Hide all_ apply to all the
completed portions in the buffer.

Notice that by design, this feature only applies to completed proofs,
_after_ they have been processed by the proof assistant.  When files
are first visited in Proof General, no information is stored about
proof boundaries.

The relevant elisp functions and settings are mentioned below.

 -- Command: pg-toggle-visibility
     Toggle visibility of region under point.

 -- Command: pg-show-all-proofs
     Display all completed proofs in the buffer.

 -- Command: pg-hide-all-proofs
     Hide all completed proofs in the buffer.

 -- User Option: proof-disappearing-proofs
     Non-nil causes Proof General to hide proofs as they are completed.

     The default value is `nil'.


File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: Switching between proof scripts,  Next: View of processed files,  Prev: Visibility of completed proofs,  Up: Advanced Script Management and Editing

3.4 Switching between proof scripts
===================================

Basic modularity in large proof developments can be achieved by
splitting proof scripts across various files. Let's assume that you are
in the middle of a proof development. You are working on a soundness
proof of Hoare Logic in a file called(1) `HSound.l'. It depends on a
number of other files which develop underlying concepts e.g. syntax and
semantics of expressions, assertions, imperative programs. You notice
that the current lemma is too difficult to prove because you have
forgotten to prove some more basic properties about determinism of the
programming language. Or perhaps a previous definition is too
cumbersome or even wrong.

At this stage, you would like to visit the appropriate file, say
`sos.l' and retract to where changes are required. Then, using script
management, you want to develop some more basic theory in `sos.l'. Once
this task has been completed (possibly involving retraction across even
earlier files) and the new development has been asserted, you want to
switch back to `HSound.l' and replay to the point you got stuck
previously.

Some hours (or days) later you have completed the soundness proof and
are ready to tackle new challenges. Perhaps, you want to prove a
property that builds on soundness or you want to prove an orthogonal
property such as completeness.

Proof General lets you do all of this while maintaining the consistency
between proof script buffers and the state of the proof assistant.
However, you cannot have more than one buffer where only a fraction of
the proof script contains a locked region. Before you can employ script
management in  another proof script buffer, you must either fully assert
or retract the current script buffer.

---------- Footnotes ----------

(1) The suffix may depend of the specific proof assistant you are using
e.g, LEGO's proof script files have to end with `.l'.


File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: View of processed files,  Next: Retracting across files,  Prev: Switching between proof scripts,  Up: Advanced Script Management and Editing

3.5 View of processed files
===========================

Proof General tries to be aware of all files that the proof assistant
has processed or is currently processing.  In the best case, it relies
on the proof assistant explicitly telling it whenever it processes a new
file which corresponds(1) to a file containing a proof script.

If the current proof script buffer depends on background material from
other files, proof assistants typically process these files
automatically. If you visit such a file, the whole file is locked as
having been processed in a single step.  From the user's point of view,
you can only retract but not assert in this buffer. Furthermore,
retraction is only possible to the _beginning_ of the buffer.

Unlike a script buffer that has been processed step-by-step via Proof
General, automatically loaded script buffers do not pass through a
"red" phase to indicate that they are currently being processed.  This
is a limitation of the present implementation.  Proof General locks a
buffer as soon as it sees the appropriate message from the proof
assistant.  Different proof assistants may use different messages:
either _early locking_ when processing a file begins (e.g. LEGO) or
_late locking_ when processing a file ends (e.g. Isabelle).

With _early locking_, you may find that a script which has only been
partly processed (due to an error or interrupt, for example), is
wrongly completely locked by Proof General.  Visit the file and retract
back to the start to fix this.

With _late locking_, there is the chance that you can break
synchronization by editing a file as it is being read by the proof
assistant, and saving it before processing finishes.

In fact, there is a general problem of editing files which may be
processed by the proof assistant automatically.  Synchronization can be
broken whenever you have unsaved changes in a proof script buffer and
the proof assistant processes the corresponding file.  (Of course, this
problem is familiar from program development using separate editors and
compilers).  The good news is that Proof General can detect the problem
and flashes up a warning in the response buffer.  You can then visit
the modified buffer, save it and retract to the beginning. Then you are
back on track.

---------- Footnotes ----------

(1) For example, LEGO generates additional compiled (optimised) proof
script files for efficiency.

3.6 Retracting across files
===========================

Make sure that the current script buffer has either been completely
asserted or retracted (Proof General enforces this).  Then you can
retract proof scripts in a different file. Simply visit a file that has
been processed earlier and retract in it, using the retraction commands
from *note Script processing commands::. Apart from removing parts of
the locked region in this buffer, all files which depend on it will be
retracted (and thus unlocked) automatically. Proof General reminds you
that now is a good time to save any unmodified buffers.


File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: Asserting across files,  Next: Automatic multiple file handling,  Prev: Retracting across files,  Up: Advanced Script Management and Editing

3.7 Asserting across files
==========================

Make sure that the current script buffer has either been completely
asserted or retracted. Then you can assert proof scripts in a different
file. Simply visit a file that contains no locked region and assert some
command with the usual assertion commands, *note Script processing
commands::. Proof General reminds you that now is a good time to save
any unmodified buffers.  This is particularly useful as assertion may
cause the proof assistant to automatically process other files.


File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: Automatic multiple file handling,  Next: Escaping script management,  Prev: Asserting across files,  Up: Advanced Script Management and Editing

3.8 Automatic multiple file handling
====================================

To make it easier to adapt Proof General for a proof assistant, there is
another possibility for multiple file support -- that it is provided
automatically by Proof General and not integrated with the
file-management system of the proof assistant.

In this case, Proof General assumes that the only files processed are
the ones it has sent to the proof assistant itself.  Moreover, it
(conservatively) assumes that there is a linear dependency between files
in the order they were processed.

If you only have automatic multiple file handling, you'll find that any
files loaded directly by the proof assistant are _not_ locked when you
visit them in Proof General.  Moreover, if you retract a file it may
retract more than is strictly necessary (because it assumes a linear
dependency).

For further technical details of the ways multiple file scripting is
configured, see Handling multiple files in the Adapting Proof General
manual.


File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: Escaping script management,  Next: Editing features,  Prev: Automatic multiple file handling,  Up: Advanced Script Management and Editing

3.9 Escaping script management
==============================

Occasionally you may want to review the dialogue of the entire session
with the proof assistant, or check that it hasn't done something
unexpected.  Experienced users may also want to directly communicate
with the proof assistant rather than sending commands via the
minibuffer, *note Proof assistant commands::.

Although the proof shell is usually hidden from view, it is run in a
buffer which you can use to interact with the prover if necessary.  You
can switch to it using the menu:

       Proof-General -> Buffers -> Shell

Warning: you can probably cause confusion by typing in the shell
buffer!  Proof General may lose track of the state of the proof
assistant.  Output from the assistant is only fully monitored when Proof
General is in control of the shell.  When in control, Proof General
watches the output from the proof assistant to guess when a file is
loaded or when a proof step is taken or undone.  What happens when you
type in the shell buffer directly depends on how complete the
communication is between Proof General and the prover (which depends on
the particular instantiation of Proof General).

If synchronization is lost, you have two options to resynchronize. If
you are lucky, it might suffice to use the key:

`C-c C-z'
     `proof-frob-locked-end'

This command is disabled by default, to protect novices using it
accidently.

If `proof-frob-locked-end' does not work, you will need to restart
script management altogether (*note Proof assistant commands::).

 -- Command: proof-frob-locked-end
     Move the end of the locked region backwards to regain
     synchronization.
     Only for use by consenting adults.

     This command can be used to repair synchronization in case
     something goes wrong and you want to tell Proof General that the
     proof assistant has processed less of your script than Proof
     General thinks.

     You should only use it to move the locked region to the end of a
     proof command.


File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: Editing features,  Prev: Escaping script management,  Up: Advanced Script Management and Editing

3.10 Editing features
=====================

To make editing proof scripts more productive, Proof General provides
some additional editing commands.

One facility is the input ring of previously processed commands.  This
allows a convenient way of repeating an earlier command or a small edit
of it.  The feature is reminiscent of history mechanisms provided in
shell terminals (and the implementation is borrowed from the Emacs
Comint package).  The input ring only contains commands which have been
successfully processed (coloured blue).  Duplicated commands are only
entered once.  The size of the ring is set by the variable
`pg-input-ring-size'.

`M-p'
     `pg-previous-matching-input-from-input'

`M-n'
     `pg-next-matching-input-from-input'

 -- Command: pg-previous-input arg
     Cycle backwards through input history, saving input.

 -- Command: pg-next-input arg
     Cycle forwards through input history.

 -- Command: pg-previous-matching-input regexp n
     Search backwards through input history for match for REGEXP.
     (Previous history elements are earlier commands.)  With prefix
     argument N, search for Nth previous match.  If N is negative, find
     the next or Nth next match.

 -- Command: pg-next-matching-input regexp n
     Search forwards through input history for match for REGEXP.
     (Later history elements are more recent commands.)  With prefix
     argument N, search for Nth following match.  If N is negative,
     find the previous or Nth previous match.

 -- Command: pg-previous-matching-input-from-input n
     Search backwards through input history for match for current input.
     (Previous history elements are earlier commands.)  With prefix
     argument N, search for Nth previous match.  If N is negative,
     search forwards for the -Nth following match.

 -- Command: pg-next-matching-input-from-input n
     Search forwards through input history for match for current input.
     (Following history elements are more recent commands.)  With
     prefix argument N, search for Nth following match.  If N is
     negative, search backwards for the -Nth previous match.

4 Unicode symbols and special layout support
********************************************

Proof General inherits support for displaying Unicode (and any other)
fonts from the underlying Emacs program.  If you are lucky, your system
will be able to use or synthesise a font that provides a rich set of
mathematical symbols.  To store symbols directly in files you need to
use a particular coding, for example UTF-8.  Newer Emacs versions can
handle a multitude of different coding systems and will try to
automatically detect an appropriate one; consult the Emacs documentation
for more details.  Of course, the prover that you are using will need to
understand the same encodings and symbol meanings.

Alternatively, you can use the Unicode Tokens mode provided in Proof
General to display mathematical symbols in place of sequences of other
characters (usually plain ASCII).  This can provide better
compatibility, portability, and flexibility.  Even if you use real
Unicode characters as prover input, the Unicode Tokens mode can provide
some helpful facilities for input shorthands and giving special layout.

4.1 Maths menu
==============

The Maths Menu minor mode (adapted from a menu by Dave Love) simply
adds a menu `Maths' to the main menubar for inserting common
mathematical symbols.  You can enable or disable it via the menu
       Proof-General -> Quick Options -> Minor Modes -> Unicode Maths Menu
(`proof-maths-menu-toggle').  Whether or not the symbols display well
the menus depends on the font used to display the menus (which depends
on the Emacs version, toolkit and platform).  Ordinarily, the symbols
inserted into the text will be Unicode characters which will be saved
in the file using the encoding selected by standard Emacs mechanisms.


File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: Unicode Tokens mode,  Next: Configuring tokens symbols and shortcuts,  Prev: Maths menu,  Up: Unicode symbols and special layout support

4.2 Unicode Tokens mode
=======================

The Unicode Tokens minor mode has been written specially for Proof
General (with thanks to Stefan Monnier for providing inspiration and a
starting point).  It supports the display of symbols when the underlying
text of the file and buffer actually contains something else, typically,
plain ASCII text.  It provides backward compatibility with the older
X-Symbol mode.

Unicode Tokens can be enabled or disabled using the menu:
       Proof-General -> Quick Options -> Display -> Unicode Tokens
The mode to allows ASCII tokens (i.e., sequences of plain ASCII
characters) to be displayed as Unicode character compositions, perhaps
with additional text properties.  The additional text properties allow
the use of tokens to cause font changes (bold, italic), text size
changes, and sub-script/super-script.

For example, the ASCII sequences `/\' or `\<And>' could be displayed as
a conjunction symbol.  The sequence `x __ y' might be written to
display `y' as subscript.  This allows a file to be stored in perfectly
portable plain ASCII encoding, but be displayed and edited with real
symbols and appealing layout.  Of course, the proof assistant needs to
understand the underlying tokens in each case.

Technically, the mechanism is based on Emacs Font Lock facility, using
the `composition' text property to display ASCII character sequence
tokens as something else.  This means that the underlying buffer text is
not altered.  This is a major advantage over the older X-Symbol (and
the experimental version of Unicode Tokens in PG 3.7.1), which had the
annoying risk of saving your buffer text in a corrupted format.  This
can never happen with the new mode.

When the Unicode Tokens mode is enabled, Maths Menu is automatically
modified to insert tokenised versions of the Unicode characters
(whenever a reverse mapping can be found).  This means that you can
still use the Maths Menu to conveniently input symbols.  You can easily
add custom key bindings for particular symbols you need to enter often
(*note Adding your own keybindings:: for examples).

The Unicode Tokens mode also allows short-cut sequences of ordinary
characters to quickly type tokens (similarly to the facility provided by
X-Symbol).  These, along with the token settings themselves, are
configured on a per-prover basis.


File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: Configuring tokens symbols and shortcuts,  Next: Special layout,  Prev: Unicode Tokens mode,  Up: Unicode symbols and special layout support

4.3 Configuring tokens symbols and shortcuts
============================================

To edit the strings used to display tokens, or the collection of
short-cuts, you can edit the file `PA-unicode-tokens.el', or customize
the main variables it contains, for example `PA-token-name-alist' and
`PA-shortcut-alist'.

E.g., for Isabelle
       M-x customize-variable isar-token-name-alist RET
provides an interface to the tokens, and
       M-x customize-variable isar-shortcut-alist
an interface to the shortcuts.

Where possible, it is better to use the more fine grained way is
available to do this, which edits the separate tables which are combine
to form the big list of tokens.  This is available via the menus, e.g.,
in Isabelle, use
       Tokens -> Customize -> Extended Symbols
to customize the symbols used for the "extended" (non standard) symbol
list.


File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: Special layout,  Next: Moving between Unicode and tokens,  Prev: Configuring tokens symbols and shortcuts,  Up: Unicode symbols and special layout support

4.4 Special layout
==================

The Unicode Tokens mode supports both symbol tokens used to display
character sequences in different ways and control tokens used to
control the layout of the text in various ways, such as superscript,
subscript, large, small, bold, italic, etc.  (The size and position
layout is managed using Emacs's `display' text property)

As well as displaying token sequences as special symbols, symbol tokens
themselves can define layout options as well; for example you might
define a token `\<hugeOplus>' to display a large circled-plus glyph.
If you try the customization mentioned in the section above you will
see the options available when defining symbols.

These options are fixed layout schemes which also make layout tokens
easy to configure for provers.  The layout possibilities include the
ones shown in the table below.  There are two ways of configuring
control tokens for layout: character controls and region controls.  The
character controls apply to the next "character", although this is a
prover-specific notion and might actually mean the next word or
identifier.  An example might be writing `BOLDCHAR x' to make a bold x.
Similarly the region controls apply to a delineated region of text, for
example, writing `BEGINBOLD this is bold ENDBOLD' could cause the
enclosed text this is bold to be displayed in a bold font.

The control tokens that have been configured populate the Tokens menu,
so, for example, you may be able to select a region of text and then
use the menu item:
       Tokens -> Format Region -> Bold
to cause the bold region tokens to be inserted around the selected
text, which should cause the buffer presentation to show the text in a
bold format (hiding the tokens).

Here is the table of layout controls available.  What you actually can
use will depend on the configuration for the underlying prover.
`sub'
     lower the text (subscript)

`sup'
     raise the text (superscript)

`bold'
     make the text be in the bold weight of the current font

`italic'
     make the text be in the italic variant of the current font

`big'
     make the text be in a bigger size of the current font

`small'
     make the text be in a smaller size of the current font

`underline'
     underline the text

`overline'
     overline the text

`script'
     display the text in a "script" font

`frakt'
     display the text in a "fraktur" font

`serif'
     display the text in a serif font

`sans'
     display the text in a sans serif font

`keyword'
     display the text in the keyword face (`font-lock-keyword-face')

`function'
     display the text in the function name face
     (`font-lock-function-name-face')

`type'
     display the text in the type name face (`font-lock-type-face')

`preprocessor'
     display the text in the preprocessor face
     (`font-lock-preprocessor-face')

`doc'
     display the text in the documentation face (`font-lock-doc-face')

`builtin'
     display the text in the builtin face (`font-lock-builtin-face')

Notice that the fonts can be set conveniently by the menu commands
             Tokens -> Set Fonts -> Script
etc.  *Note Selecting suitable fonts::, for more.

The symbols used to select the various font-lock faces (see `M-x
list-faces-display' to show them) allow you to define custom colouring

4.5 Moving between Unicode and tokens
=====================================

If you want to share text between applications (e.g., email some text
from an Isabelle theory file which heavily uses symbols), it is useful
to convert to and from Unicode with cut-and-paste operations.  The
default buffer cut and paste functions will copy the underlying text,
which contains the tokens (ASCII format).  To copy and convert or paste
then convert back, use these commands:
       Tokens -> Copy as unicode
       Tokens -> Paste from unicode

Both of these are necessarily approximate.  The buffer presentation may
use additional controls (for super/subscript layout or bold fonts,
etc), which cannot be converted.  Pasting relies on being able to
identify a unique token mapped from a single Unicode character; the
token table may not include such an entry, or may be ambiguous.

 -- Command: unicode-tokens-copy beg end
     Copy presentation of region between BEG and END.
     This is an approximation; it makes assumptions about the behaviour
     of symbol compositions, and will lose layout information.

 -- Command: unicode-tokens-paste
     Paste text from clipboard, converting Unicode to tokens where
     possible.

If you are using a mixture of "real" Unicode and tokens like this you
may want to be careful to check the buffer contents: the command
`unicode-tokens-highlight-unicode' helps you to manage this.  It is
available on the Tokens menu as
       Tokens -> Highlight Real Unicode Chars
Alternative ways to check are to toggle the display of tokens using
       Tokens -> Reveal Symbol Tokens
(the similar entry for `Control Tokens' displays tokens being used to
control layout).  Or simply toggle the tokens mode, which will leave
the true Unicode tokens untouched.

 -- Variable: unicode-tokens-highlight-unicode
     Non-nil to highlight Unicode characters.


File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: Finding available tokens shortcuts and symbols,  Next: Selecting suitable fonts,  Prev: Moving between Unicode and tokens,  Up: Unicode symbols and special layout support

4.6 Finding available tokens shortcuts and symbols
==================================================

Two commands (both on the Tokens menu) allow you to see the tokens and
shortcuts available:
             Tokens -> List Tokens
             Tokens -> List Shortcuts

Additionally, you can view the complete Unicode character set available
in the default Emacs font, with
             Tokens -> List Unicode Characters
(this uses a list adapted from Norman Walsh's `unichars.el').

Note that the Unicode Tokens modes displays symbols defined by symbol
tokens in a special font.

 -- Command: unicode-tokens-list-tokens
     Show a buffer of all tokens.

 -- Command: unicode-tokens-list-shortcuts
     Show a buffer of all the shortcuts available.

 -- Command: unicode-tokens-list-unicode-chars
     Insert each Unicode character into a buffer.
     Lets you see which characters are available for literal display in
     your emacs font.

     (fn)


File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: Selecting suitable fonts,  Prev: Finding available tokens shortcuts and symbols,  Up: Unicode symbols and special layout support

4.7 Selecting suitable fonts
============================

The precise set of symbol glyphs that are available to you will depend
in complicated ways on your operating system, Emacs version,
configuration options used when Emacs was compiled, installed font sets,
and (even) command line options used to start Emacs.  So it is hard to
give comprehensive and accurate advice in this manual.  In general,
things work much better with Emacs 23 than earlier versions.

To improve flexibility, Unicode Tokens mode allows you to select another
font to display symbols from the default font that is used to display
text in the buffer.    This is the font that is configured by the menu
             Tokens -> Set Fonts -> Symbol
its customization name is `unicode-tokens-symbol-font-face', but notice
that only the font family aspect of the face is used.  Similarly, other
fonts can be configured for controling different font families (script,
fraktur, etc).

For symbols, good results are possible by using a proportional font for
displaying symbols that has many symbol glyphs, for example the main
font StixGeneral font from the Stix Fonts project
(`http://www.stixfonts.org/').  At the time of writing you can obtain a
beta version of these fonts in TTF format from
`http://olegueret.googlepages.com/stixfonts-ttf'.  On recent Linux
distributions and with an Emacs 23 build that uses Xft, simply copy
these `ttf' files into the `.fonts' directory inside your home
directory to make them available.

Another font I like is DejaVu Sans Mono.  It covers all of the standard
Isabelle symbols.  Some of the symbols are currently not perfect;
however this font is an open source effort so users can contribute or
suggest improvements.  See `http://dejavu-fonts.org'.

If you are stuck with Emacs 22, you need to use the fontset mechanism
which configures sets of fonts to use for display.  The default font
sets may not include enough symbols (typical symptom: symbols display
as empty boxes).  To address this, the menu command
             Tokens -> Set Fonts -> Make Fontsets
constructs a number of fontsets at particular point sizes, based on
several widely available fonts.  See `pg-fontsets.el' for the code.
After running this command, you can select from additional fontsets from
the menus for changing fonts.

For further suggestions, please search (and contribute!) to the Proof
General wiki at `http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/wiki'.

 -- Face: unicode-tokens-symbol-font-face
     The default font used for symbols.  Only :family and :slant
     attributes are used.

5 Support for other Packages
****************************

Proof General makes some configuration for other Emacs packages which
provide various useful facilities that can make your editing more
effective.

Sometimes this configuration is purely at the proof assistant specific
level (and so not necessarily available), and sometimes it is made using
Proof General settings.

When adding support for a new proof assistant, we suggest that these
other packages are supported, as a convention.

The packages currently supported include `font-lock', `imenu' and
`speedbar', `outline-mode', `completion', and `etags'.

* Menu:

* Syntax highlighting::
* Imenu and Speedbar::
* Support for outline mode::
* Support for completion::
* Support for tags::


File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: Syntax highlighting,  Next: Imenu and Speedbar,  Up: Support for other Packages

5.1 Syntax highlighting
=======================

Proof script buffers are decorated (or fontified) with colours, bold
and italic fonts, etc, according to the syntax of the proof language and
the settings for `font-lock-keywords' made by the proof assistant
specific portion of Proof General.  Moreover, Proof General usually
decorates the output from the proof assistant, also using `font-lock'.

To automatically switch on fontification in Emacs, you may need to
engage `M-x global-font-lock-mode'.

By the way, the choice of colour, font, etc, for each kind of markup is
fully customizable in Proof General.  Each _face_ (Emacs terminology)
is controlled by its own customization setting.  You can display a list
of all of them using the customize menu:
     Proof General -> Advanced -> Customize -> Faces -> Proof Faces.


File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: Imenu and Speedbar,  Next: Support for outline mode,  Prev: Syntax highlighting,  Up: Support for other Packages

5.2 Imenu and Speedbar
======================

The Emacs package `imenu' (Index Menu) provides a menu built from the
names of entities (e.g., theorems, definitions, etc) declared in a
buffer.  This allows easy navigation within the file.  Proof General
configures both packages automatically so that you can quickly jump to
particular proofs in a script buffer.

(Developers note: the automatic configuration is done with the settings
`proof-goal-with-hole-regexp' and `proof-save-with-hole-regexp'.
Better configuration may be made manually with several other settings,
see the Adapting Proof General manual for further details).

To use Imenu, select the option
             Proof-General -> Quick Options -> Minor Modes -> Index Menu
This adds an "Index" menu to the main menu bar for proof script buffers.
You can also use `M-x imenu' for keyboard-driven completion of tags
built from names in the buffer.

Speedbar displays a file tree in a separate window on the display,
allowing quick navigation.  Middle/double-clicking or pressing `+' on a
file icon opens up to display tags (definitions, theorems, etc) within
the file.  Middle/double-clicking on a file or tag jumps to that file
or tag.

To use Speedbar, use
             Proof-General -> Quick Options -> Minor Modes -> Speedbar
If you prefer the old fashioned way, `M-x speedbar' does the same job.

For more information about Speedbar, see
`http://cedet.sourceforge.net/speedbar.shtml'.


File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: Support for outline mode,  Next: Support for completion,  Prev: Imenu and Speedbar,  Up: Support for other Packages

5.3 Support for outline mode
============================

Proof General configures Emacs variables (`outline-regexp' and
`outline-heading-end-regexp') so that outline minor mode can be used on
proof script files.  The headings taken for outlining are the "goal"
statements at the start of goal-save sequences, *note Goal-save
sequences::. If you want to use `outline' to hide parts of the proof
script in the _locked_ region, you need to disable
`proof-strict-read-only'.

Use `M-x outline-minor-mode' to turn on outline minor mode.  Functions
for navigating, hiding, and revealing the proof script are available in
menus.

Please note that outline-mode may not work well in processed proof
script files, because of read-only restrictions of the protected region.
This is an inherent problem with outline because it works by modifying
the buffer.  If you want to use outline with processed scripts, you can
turn off the `Strict Read Only' option.

See *note ((emacs))Outline Mode:: for more information about outline
mode.


File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: Support for completion,  Next: Support for tags,  Prev: Support for outline mode,  Up: Support for other Packages

5.4 Support for completion
==========================

You might find the _completion_ facility of Emacs useful when you're
using Proof General.  The key `C-RET' is defined to invoke the
`complete' command.  Pressing `C-RET' cycles through completions
displaying hints in the minibuffer.

Completions are filled in according to what has been recently typed,
from a database of symbols.  The database is automatically saved at the
end of a session.

Proof General has the additional facility for setting a completion table
for each supported proof assistant, which gets loaded into the
completion database automatically.  Ideally the completion table would
be set from the running process according to the identifiers available
are within the particular context of a script file.  But until this is
available, this table may be set to contain a number of standard
identifiers available for your proof assistant.

The setting `_PA_-completion-table' holds the list of identifiers for a
proof assistant.  The function `proof-add-completions' adds these into
the completion database.

 -- Variable: PA-completion-table
     List of identifiers to use for completion for this proof assistant.
     Completion is activated with M-x complete.

     If this table is empty or needs adjusting, please make changes
     using ``customize-variable'' and post suggestions at
     http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/trac

The completion facility uses a library `completion.el' which usually
ships with Emacs, and supplies the `complete' function.

 -- Command: complete
     Fill out a completion of the word before point.
     Point is left at end.  Consecutive calls rotate through all
     possibilities.  Prefix args:
    `C-u'
          leave point at the beginning of the completion, not the end.

    `a number'
          rotate through the possible completions by that amount

    `0'
          same as -1 (insert previous completion)
     See the comments at the top of `completion.el' for more info.


File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: Support for tags,  Prev: Support for completion,  Up: Support for other Packages

5.5 Support for tags
====================

An Emacs "tags table" is a description of how a multi-file system is
broken up into files.  It lists the names of the component files and the
names and positions of the functions (or other named subunits) in each
file.  Grouping the related files makes it possible to search or replace
through all the files with one command.  Recording the function names
and positions makes possible the `M-.' command which finds the
definition of a function by looking up which of the files it is in.

Some instantiations of Proof General (currently LEGO and Coq) are
supplied with external programs (`legotags' and `coqtags') for making
tags tables.  For example, invoking `coqtags *.v' produces a file
`TAGS' for all files `*.v' in the current directory. Invoking `coqtags
`find . -name \*.v`' produces a file `TAGS' for all files ending in
`.v' in the current directory structure. Once a tag table has been made
for your proof developments, you can use the Emacs tags mechanisms to
find tags, and complete symbols from tags table.

One useful key-binding you might want to make is to set the usual tags
completion key `M-tab' to run `tag-complete-symbol' to use completion
from names in the tag table.  To set this binding in Proof General
script buffers, put this code in your `.emacs' file:
     (add-hook 'proof-mode-hook
       (lambda () (local-set-key '(meta tab) 'tag-complete-symbol)))
Since this key-binding interferes with a default binding that users may
already have customized (or may be taken by the window manager), Proof
General doesn't do this automatically.

Apart from completion, there are several other operations on tags.  One
common one is replacing identifiers across all files using
`tags-query-replace'.  For more information on how to use tags, *note
((emacs))Tags::.

To use tags for completion at the same time as the completion mechanism
mentioned already, you can use the command `M-x
add-completions-from-tags-table'.

 -- Command: add-completions-from-tags-table
     Add completions from the current tags table.

6 Subterm Activation and Proof by Pointing
******************************************

This chapter describes what you can do from inside the goals buffer,
providing support for these features exists for your proof assistant.

As of Proof General 4.0, this support only exists for LEGO and
proof-by-pointing functionality has been temporarily removed from the
interface.  If you would like to see subterm activation support for
Proof General in another proof assistant, please petition the developers
of that proof assistant to provide it!

* Menu:

* Goals buffer commands::


File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: Goals buffer commands,  Up: Subterm Activation and Proof by Pointing

6.1 Goals buffer commands
=========================

When you are developing a proof, the input focus (Emacs cursor) is
usually on the script buffer.  Therefore Proof General binds some mouse
buttons for commands in the goals buffer, to avoid the need to move the
cursor between buffers.

The mouse bindings are these:

`mouse-1'
     `pg-goals-button-action'

`C-mouse-3'
     `proof-undo-and-delete-last-successful-command'

`C-S-mouse-1'
     `pg-identifier-under-mouse-query'

Where `mouse-1' indicates the left mouse button, and `mouse-3'
indicates the right hand mouse button.  The functions available provide
a way to construct commands automatically (`pg-goals-button-action')
and to inspect identifiers (`pg-identifier-under-mouse-query') as the
Info toolbar button does.

Proof-by-pointing is a cute idea.  It lets you automatically construct
parts of a proof by clicking.  You can ask the proof assistant to try to
do a step in the proof, based on where you click.  If you don't like the
command which was inserted into the script, you can comment use the
control key with the right button to undo the step and delete it from
your script (`proof-undo-and-delete-last-successful-command').

Proof-by-pointing may construct several commands in one go.  These are
sent back to the proof assistant altogether and appear as a single step
in the proof script.  However, if the proof is later replayed (without
using PBP), the proof-by-pointing constructions will be considered as
separate proof commands, as usual.

The main function for proof-by-pointing is `pg-goals-button-action'.

 -- Command: pg-goals-button-action event
     Construct a proof-by-pointing command based on the mouse-click
     EVENT.
     This function should be bound to a mouse button in the Proof
     General goals buffer.

     The EVENT is used to find the smallest subterm around a point.  A
     position code for the subterm is sent to the proof assistant, to
     ask it to construct an appropriate proof command.  The command
     which is constructed will be inserted at the end of the locked
     region in the proof script buffer, and immediately sent back to
     the proof assistant.  If it succeeds, the locked region will be
     extended to cover the proof-by-pointing command, just as for any
     proof command the user types by hand.

Proof-by-pointing uses markup describing the term structure of the
concrete syntax output by the proof assistant.  This markup is useful in
itself: it allows you to explore the structure of a term using the mouse
(the smallest subexpression that the mouse is over is highlighted), and
easily copy subterms from the output to a proof script.

 -- Command: pg-identifier-under-mouse-query event
     Query the prover about the identifier near mouse click EVENT.

7 Graphical Proof-Tree Visualization
************************************

Since version 4.2, Proof General supports proof-tree visualization on
graphical desktops via the additional program Prooftree. Currently,
proof-tree visualization is only supported for the Coq proof assistant.
For installation instructions and more detailed information about
Prooftree, please refer to the Prooftree website
(http://askra.de/software/prooftree/) and the Prooftree man page
(http://askra.de/software/prooftree/prooftree.man.html). For
information about how to support proof-tree visualization for a
different proof assistant, see Section Configuring Proof-Tree
Visualization in the Adapting Proof General manual.

* Prooftree Customization::


File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: Starting and Stopping Proof-Tree Visualization,  Next: Features of Prooftree,  Up: Graphical Proof-Tree Visualization

7.1 Starting and Stopping Proof-Tree Visualization
==================================================

When proof-tree visualization is supported (currently only for the Coq
proof assistant), you can start the visualization via the proof-tree
button in the tool-bar, via the menu
        Proof-General -> Start/Stop Prooftree
or via the keyboard shortcut `C-c C-d', all of which invoke
`proof-tree-external-display-toggle'.

If you are inside a proof, the graphical display is started immediately
for your current proof. Otherwise the display starts as soon as you
start the next proof. Starting the proof-tree display in the middle of
a proof involves an automatic reexecution of your current proof script
in the locked region, which should be almost unnoticeable, except for
the time it takes.

The proof-tree display stops at the end of the proof or when you invoke
`proof-tree-external-display-toggle' by one of the three indicated
means again. Alternatively you can also close the proof-tree window.

Proof General launches only one instance of Prooftree, which can manage
an arbitrary amount of proof-tree windows.


File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: Features of Prooftree,  Next: Prooftree Customization,  Prev: Starting and Stopping Proof-Tree Visualization,  Up: Graphical Proof-Tree Visualization

7.2 Features of Prooftree
=========================

The proof-tree window provides visual information about the status of
the different branches in your proof (by coloring completely proved
branches in green, for example) and means for inspecting previous proof
states without the need to retract parts of your proof script.
Currently, Prooftree provides the following features:

   * Navigation in the proof tree and display of all previous proof
     states and proof commands.

   * Display branches of the proof in different colors according to
     their proof state, distinguishing branches with open, partially or
     fully instantiated existential variables as well as branches that
     have been finished by a cheating command such as `admit'.

   * Display the status of existential variables and their dependencies.

   * Mark proof commands that introduce or instantiate a given
     existential variable.

   * Snapshots of proof trees for reference when you retract your proof
     to try a different approach.

For a more elaborated description please consult the help dialog of
Prooftree or the Prooftree man page
(http://askra.de/software/prooftree/prooftree.man.html).

7.3 Prooftree Customization
===========================

The location of the Prooftree program and command line arguments can be
configured in the customization group `proof-tree'. You can visit this
customization group inside a running instance of Proof General by
typing `M-x customize-group <RET> proof-tree <RET>'.

The graphical aspects of the proof-tree rendering, fonts and colors can
be changed inside Prooftree by invoking the `Configuration' item of the
main menu.

Prover specific parts such as the regular expressions for recognizing
subgoals, existential variables and navigation and cheating commands
are in the customization group `proof-tree-internals'. Under normal
circumstances there should be no need to change one of these internal
settings.

8 Customizing Proof General
***************************

There are two ways of customizing Proof General: it can be customized
for a user's preferences using a particular proof assistant, or it can
be customized by a developer to add support for a new proof assistant.
The latter kind of customization we call instantiation, or _adapting_.
See the Adapting Proof General manual for how to do this.  Here we
cover the user-level customization for Proof General.

There are two kinds of user-level settings in Proof General:
   * Settings that apply _globally_ to all proof assistants.

   * those that can be adjusted for each proof assistant _individually_.
The first sort have names beginning with `proof-'.  The second sort
have names which begin with a symbol corresponding to the proof
assistant: for example, `isa-', `coq-', etc.  The symbol is the root of
the mode name.  *Note Quick start guide::, for a table of the supported
modes.  To stand for an arbitrary proof assistant, we write `_PA_-' for
these names.

In this chapter we only consider the generic settings: ones which apply
to all proof assistants (globally or individually).  The support for a
particular proof assistant may provide extra individual customization
settings not available in other proof assistants.  See the chapters
covering each assistant for details of those settings.

File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: Basic options,  Next: How to customize,  Up: Customizing Proof General

8.1 Basic options
=================

Proof General has some common options which you can toggle directly from
the menu:
        Proof-General -> Quick Options
The effect of changing one of these options will be seen immediately (or
in the next proof step).  The window-control options on this menu are
described shortly.  *Note Display customization::.

To save the current settings for these options (only), use the Save
Options command in the submenu:
        Proof-General -> Quick Options -> Save Options
or `M-x customize-save-customized'.

The options on this sub-menu are also available in the complete user
customization options group for Proof General.  For this you need to
know a little bit about how to customize in Emacs.


File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: How to customize,  Next: Display customization,  Prev: Basic options,  Up: Customizing Proof General

8.2 How to customize
====================

Proof General uses the Emacs customization library to provide a friendly
interface.  You can access all the customization settings for Proof
General via the menu:
        Proof-General -> Advanced -> Customize

Using the customize facility is straightforward.  You can select the
setting to customize via the menus, or with `M-x customize-variable'.
When you have selected a setting, you are shown a buffer with its
current value, and facility to edit it.  Once you have edited it, you
can use the special buttons SET, SAVE and DONE.  You must use one of
SET or SAVE to get any effect.  The SAVE button stores the setting in
your `.emacs' file.  The command `M-x customize-save-customized' or
Emacs menubar item `Options -> Save Options' saves all settings you
have edited.

A technical note.  In the customize menus, the variable names mentioned
later in this chapter may be abbreviated -- the "`proof'-" or similar
prefixes are omitted.  Also, some of the option settings may have more
descriptive names (for example, ON and OFF) than the low-level lisp
values (non-`nil', `nil') which are mentioned in this chapter.  These
features make customize rather more friendly than raw lisp.

You can also access the customize settings for Proof General from other
(non-script) buffers.  Use the menu:
        Options -> Customize Emacs -> Top-level Customization Group
and select the `External' and then `Proof-General' groups.

The complete set of customization settings will only be available after
Proof General has been fully loaded.  Proof General is fully loaded when
you visit a script file for the first time, or if you type `M-x
load-library RET proof RET'.

For more help with customize, see *note ((emacs))Customization::.


File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: Display customization,  Next: User options,  Prev: How to customize,  Up: Customizing Proof General

8.3 Display customization
=========================

By default, Proof General displays two buffers during scripting, in a
split window on the display.  One buffer is the script buffer.  The
other buffer is either the goals buffer (`*goals*') or the response
buffer (`*response*').  Proof General raises and switches between these
last two automatically.

Proof General allows several ways to customize this default display
model, by splitting the Emacs frames in different ways and maximising
the amount of information shown, or by using multiple frames.  The
customization options are explained below; they are also available on
the menu:
       Proof-General -> Quick Options -> Display
and you can save your preferred default.

If your screen is large enough, you may prefer to display all three of
the interaction buffers at once.  This is useful, for example, to see
output from the `proof-find-theorems' command at the same time as the
subgoal list.  Set the user option `proof-three-window-enable' to make
Proof General keep both the goals and response buffer displayed.

If you prefer to switch windows and buffers manually when you want to
see the prover output, you can customize the user option
`proof-auto-raise-buffers' to prevent the automatic behaviour.  You can
browse interaction output by hovering the mouse over the command
regions in the proof script.

 -- User Option: proof-auto-raise-buffers
     If non-nil, automatically raise buffers to display latest output.
     If this is not set, buffers and windows will not be managed by
     Proof General.

     The default value is `t'.

 -- User Option: proof-three-window-enable
     Whether response and goals buffers have dedicated windows.
     If non-nil, Emacs windows displaying messages from the prover will
     not be switchable to display other windows.

     This option can help manage your display.

     Setting this option triggers a three-buffer mode of interaction
     where the goals buffer and response buffer are both displayed,
     rather than the two-buffer mode where they are switched between.
     It also prevents Emacs automatically resizing windows between
     proof steps.

     If you use several frames (the same Emacs in several windows on the
     screen), you can force a frame to stick to showing the goals or
     response buffer.

     The default value is `nil'.

Sometimes during script management, there is no response from the proof
assistant to some command.  In this case you might like the empty
response window to be hidden so you have more room to see the proof
script.  The setting `proof-delete-empty-windows' helps you do this.

 -- User Option: proof-delete-empty-windows
     If non-nil, automatically remove windows when they are cleaned.
     For example, at the end of a proof the goals buffer window will be
     cleared; if this flag is set it will automatically be removed.  If
     you want to fix the sizes of your windows you may want to set this
     variable to `'nil'' to avoid windows being deleted automatically.
     If you use multiple frames, only the windows in the currently
     selected frame will be automatically deleted.

     The default value is `nil'.
This option only has an effect when you have set
`proof-three-window-mode'.

If you are working on a machine with a window system, you can use Emacs
to manage several frames on the display, to keep the goals buffer
displayed in a fixed place on your screen and in a certain font, for
example.  A convenient way to do this is via the user option

 -- User Option: proof-multiple-frames-enable
     Whether response and goals buffers have separate frames.
     If non-nil, Emacs will make separate frames (screen windows) for
     the goals and response buffers, by altering the Emacs variable
     ``special-display-regexps''.

     The default value is `nil'.
Multiple frames work best when `proof-delete-empty-windows' is off and
`proof-three-window-mode' is on.

Finally, there are two commands available which help to switch between
buffers or refresh the window layout.  These are on the menu:
       Proof-General -> Buffers

 -- Command: proof-display-some-buffers
     Display the reponse, trace, goals, or shell buffer, rotating.
     A fixed number of repetitions of this command switches back to the
     same buffer.  Also move point to the end of the response buffer if
     it's selected.  If in three window or multiple frame mode, display
     two buffers.  The idea of this function is to change the
     window->buffer mapping without adjusting window layout.

 -- Command: proof-layout-windows &optional nohorizontalsplit
     Refresh the display of windows according to current display mode.

     For single frame mode, this uses a canonical layout made by
     splitting Emacs windows vertically in equal proportions.  You can
     then adjust the proportions by dragging the separating bars.  In
     three pane mode, the canonical layout is to split both
     horizontally and vertically, to display the prover responses in
     two panes on the right-hand side, and the proof script in a taller
     pane on the left.  A prefix argument will prevent the horizontal
     split, and result in three windows spanning the full width of the
     Emacs frame.

     For multiple frame mode, this function obeys the setting of
     ``pg-response-eagerly-raise'', which see.

 -- User Option: proof-shrink-windows-tofit
     If non-nil, automatically shrink output windows to fit contents.
     In single-frame mode, this option will reduce the size of the
     goals and response windows to fit their contents.

     The default value is `nil'.

 -- User Option: proof-colour-locked
     If non-nil, colour the locked region with ``proof-locked-face''.
     If this is not set, buffers will have no special face set on
     locked regions.

     The default value is `t'.

 -- User Option: proof-output-tooltips
     Non-nil causes Proof General to add tooltips for prover output.
     Hovers will be added when this option is non-nil.  Prover outputs
     can be displayed when the mouse hovers over the region that
     produced it and output is available (see
     ``proof-full-annotation'').  If output is not available, the type
     of the output region is displayed.  Changes of this option will
     not be reflected in already-processed regions of the script.

     The default value is `t'.

8.4 User options
================

Here is a list of the important user options for Proof General, apart
from the display options mentioned above.

User options can be set via the customization system already mentioned,
via the old-fashioned `M-x edit-options' mechanism, or simply by adding
`setq''s to your `.emacs' file.  The first approach is strongly
recommended.

Unless mentioned, all of these settings can be changed dynamically,
without needing to restart Emacs to see the effect.  But you must use
customize to be sure that Proof General reconfigures itself properly.

 -- User Option: proof-splash-enable
     If non-nil, display a splash screen when Proof General is loaded.

     The default value is `t'.

 -- User Option: proof-electric-terminator-enable
     If non-nil, use electric terminator mode.
     If electric terminator mode is enabled, pressing a terminator will
     automatically issue `proof-assert-next-command' for convenience,
     to send the command straight to the proof process.  If the command
     you want to send already has a terminator character, you don't
     need to delete the terminator character first.  Just press the
     terminator somewhere nearby.  Electric!

     The default value is `nil'.

 -- User Option: proof-next-command-insert-space
     If non-nil, PG will use heuristics to insert newlines or spaces in
     scripts.
     In particular, if electric terminator is switched on, spaces or
     newlines will be inserted as the user types commands to the prover.

     The default value is `t'.

 -- User Option: proof-toolbar-enable
     If non-nil, display Proof General toolbar for script buffers.

     The default value is `t'.

 -- User Option: proof-query-file-save-when-activating-scripting
     If non-nil, query user to save files when activating scripting.

     Often, activating scripting or executing the first scripting
     command of a proof script will cause the proof assistant to load
     some files needed by the current proof script.  If this option is
     non-nil, the user will be prompted to save some unsaved buffers in
     case any of them corresponds to a file which may be loaded by the
     proof assistant.

     You can turn this option off if the save queries are annoying, but
     be warned that with some proof assistants this may risk processing
     files which are out of date with respect to the loaded buffers!

     The default value is `t'.

 -- User Option: PA-script-indent
     If non-nil, enable indentation code for proof scripts.

     The default value is `t'.

 -- User Option: PA-one-command-per-line
     If non-nil, format for newlines after each command in a script.

     The default value is `t'.

 -- User Option: proof-prog-name-ask
     If non-nil, query user which program to run for the inferior
     process.

     The default value is `nil'.

 -- Variable: PA-prog-args
     Arguments to be passed to ``proof-prog-name'' to run the proof
     assistant.
     If non-nil, will be treated as a list of arguments for
     ``proof-prog-name''.  Otherwise ``proof-prog-name'' will be split
     on spaces to form arguments.

     Remark: Arguments are interpreted strictly: each one must contain
     only one word, with no space (unless it is the same word). For
     example if the arguments are -x foo -y bar, then the list should
     be '("-x" "foo" "-y" "bar"), notice that '("-x foo" "-y bar") is
     *wrong*.

 -- Variable: PA-prog-env
     Modifications to ``process-environment'' made before running
     ``proof-prog-name''.
     Each element should be a string of the form ENVVARNAME=VALUE.
     They will be added to the environment before launching the prover
     (but not pervasively).  For example for coq on Windows you might
     need something like: (setq `coq-prog-env' '("HOME=C:\Program
     Files\Coq\"))

 -- User Option: proof-prog-name-guess
     If non-nil, use ``proof-guess-command-line'' to guess
     ``proof-prog-name''.
     This option is compatible with ``proof-prog-name-ask''.  No effect
     if ``proof-guess-command-line'' is nil.

     The default value is `nil'.

 -- User Option: proof-tidy-response
     Non-nil indicates that the response buffer should be cleared often.
     The response buffer can be set either to accumulate output, or to
     clear frequently.

     With this variable non-nil, the response buffer is kept tidy by
     clearing it often, typically between successive commands (just
     like the goals buffer).

     Otherwise the response buffer will accumulate output from the
     prover.

     The default value is `t'.

 -- User Option: proof-keep-response-history
     Whether to keep a browsable history of responses.
     With this feature enabled, the buffers used for prover responses
     will have a history that can be browsed without processing/undoing
     in the prover.  (Changes to this variable take effect after
     restarting the prover).

     The default value is `nil'.

 -- User Option: pg-input-ring-size
     Size of history ring of previous successfully processed commands.

     The default value is `32'.

 -- User Option: proof-general-debug
     Non-nil to run Proof General in debug mode.
     This changes some behaviour (e.g. markup stripping) and displays
     debugging messages in the response buffer.  To avoid erasing
     messages shortly after they're printed, set
     ``proof-tidy-response'' to nil.  This is only useful for PG
     developers.

     The default value is `nil'.

 -- User Option: proof-follow-mode
     Choice of how point moves with script processing commands.
     One of the symbols: `'locked', `'follow', `'followdown', `'ignore'.

     If `'locked', point sticks to the end of the locked region.  If
     `'follow', point moves just when needed to display the locked
     region end.  If `'followdown', point if necessary to stay in
     writeable region If `'ignore', point is never moved after movement
     commands or on errors.

     If you choose `'ignore', you can find the end of the locked using
     M-x `proof-goto-end-of-locked'

     The default value is `locked'.

 -- User Option: proof-auto-action-when-deactivating-scripting
     If `'retract' or `'process', do that when deactivating scripting.

     With this option set to `'retract' or `'process', when scripting
     is turned off in a partly processed buffer, the buffer will be
     retracted or processed automatically.

     With this option unset (nil), the user is questioned instead.

     Proof General insists that only one script buffer can be partly
     processed: all others have to be completely processed or completely
     unprocessed.  This is to make sure that handling of multiple files
     makes sense within the proof assistant.

     NB: A buffer is completely processed when all non-whitespace is
     locked (coloured blue); a buffer is completely unprocessed when
     there is no locked region.

     For some proof assistants (such as Coq) fully processed buffers
     make no sense. Setting this option to `'process' has then the same
     effect as leaving it unset (nil). (This behaviour is controlled by
     ``proof-no-fully-processed-buffer''.)

     The default value is `nil'.

 -- User Option: proof-rsh-command
     Shell command prefix to run a command on a remote host.
     For example,
             ssh bigjobs
     Would cause Proof General to issue the command `ssh bigjobs
     isabelle' to start Isabelle remotely on our large compute server
     called `bigjobs'.

     The protocol used should be configured so that no user interaction
     (passwords, or whatever) is required to get going.  For proper
     behaviour with interrupts, the program should also communicate
     signals to the remote host.

     The default value is `nil'.

8.5 Changing faces
==================

The numerous fonts and colours that Proof General uses are configurable.
If you alter faces through the customize menus (or the command `M-x
customize-face'), only the particular kind of display in use (colour
window system, monochrome window system, console, ...) will be
affected.  This means you can keep separate default settings for each
different display environment where you use Proof General.

As well as the faces listed below, Proof General may use the regular
`font-lock-' faces (eg `font-lock-keyword-face',
`font-lock-variable-name-face', etc) for fontifying the proof script or
proof assistant output.  These can be altered to your taste just as
easily, but note that changes will affect all other modes which use
them!

* Script buffer faces::

8.5.1 Script buffer faces
-------------------------

 -- Face: proof-queue-face
     Face for commands in proof script waiting to be processed.

 -- Face: proof-locked-face
     Face for locked region of proof script (processed commands).

 -- Face: proof-script-sticky-error-face
     Proof General face for marking an error in the proof script.

     Proof General face for highlighting an error in the proof script.

     General mouse highlighting face used in script buffer.

 -- Face: proof-highlight-dependent-face
     Face for showing (backwards) dependent parts.

 -- Face: proof-highlight-dependency-face
     Face for showing (forwards) dependencies.

 -- Face: proof-declaration-name-face
     Face for declaration names in proof scripts.
     Exactly what uses this face depends on the proof assistant.

 -- Face: proof-tacticals-name-face
     Face for names of tacticals in proof scripts.
     Exactly what uses this face depends on the proof assistant.


File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: Goals and response faces,  Prev: Script buffer faces,  Up: Changing faces

8.5.2 Goals and response faces
------------------------------

 -- Face: proof-error-face
     Face for error messages from proof assistant.

 -- Face: proof-warning-face
     Face for warning messages.
     Warning messages can come from proof assistant or from Proof
     General itself.

 -- Face: proof-debug-message-face
     Face for debugging messages from Proof General.

 -- Face: proof-boring-face
     Face for boring text in proof assistant output.

 -- Face: proof-active-area-face
     Face for showing active areas (clickable regions), outside of
     subterm markup.

 -- Face: proof-eager-annotation-face
     Face for important messages from proof assistant.

The slightly bizarre name of the last face comes from the idea that
while large amounts of output are being sent from the prover, some
messages should be displayed to the user while the bulk of the output is
hidden.  The messages which are displayed may have a special annotation
to help Proof General recognize them, and this is an "eager" annotation
in the sense that it should be processed as soon as it is observed by
Proof General.

8.6 Tweaking configuration settings
===================================

This section is a note for advanced users.

Configuration settings are the per-prover customizations of Proof
General.  These are not intended to be adjusted by the user.  But
occasionally you may like to test changes to these settings to improve
the way Proof General works.  You may want to do this when a proof
assistant has a flexible proof script language in which one can define
new tactics or even operations, and you want Proof General to recognize
some of these which the default settings don't mention.  So please feel
free to try adjusting the configuration settings and report to us if you
find better default values than the ones we have provided.

The configuration settings appear in the customization group
`prover-config', or via the menu
         Proof-General -> Internals ->  Prover Config

One basic example of a setting you may like to tweak is:

 -- Variable: proof-assistant-home-page
     Web address for information on proof assistant.
     Used for Proof General's help menu.

Most of the others are more complicated.  For more details of the
settings, see Adapting Proof General for full details.  To browse the
settings, you can look through the customization groups
`prover-config', `proof-script' and `proof-shell'.  The group
`proof-script' contains the configuration variables for scripting, and
the group `proof-shell' contains those for interacting with the proof
assistant.

Unfortunately, although you can use the customization mechanism to set
and save these variables, saving them may have no practical effect
because the default settings are mostly hard-wired into the proof
assistant code.  Ones we expect may need changing appear as proof
assistant specific configurations.  For example,
`proof-assistant-home-page' is set in the LEGO code from the value of
the customization setting `lego-www-home-page'.  At present there is no
easy way to save changes to other configuration variables across
sessions, other than by editing the source code.  (In future versions
of Proof General, we plan to make all configuration settings editable
in Customize, by shadowing the settings as prover specific ones using
the `_PA_-' mechanism).

9 Hints and Tips
****************

Apart from the packages officially supported in Proof General, many
other features of Emacs are useful when using Proof General, even
though they need no specific configuration for Proof General.  It is
worth taking a bit of time to explore the Emacs manual to find out about
them.

Here we provide some hints and tips for a couple of Emacs features which
users have found valuable with Proof General.  Further contributions to
this chapter are welcomed!

* Menu:

* Adding your own keybindings::
* Using file variables::
* Using abbreviations::


File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: Adding your own keybindings,  Next: Using file variables,  Up: Hints and Tips

9.1 Adding your own keybindings
===============================

Proof General follows Emacs convention for file modes in using <C-c>
prefix key-bindings for its own functions, which is why some of the
default keyboard short-cuts are quite lengthy.

Some users may prefer to add additional key-bindings for shorter
sequences.  This can be done interactively with the command `M-x
local-set-key', or for longevity, by adding code like this to your
`.emacs' file:

     (eval-after-load "proof-script" '(progn
      (define-key proof-mode-map [(control n)]
                                 'proof-assert-next-command-interactive)
      (define-key proof-mode-map [(control b)]
                                 'proof-undo-last-successful-command)
      ))

This lisp fragment adds bindings for every buffer in proof script mode
(the Emacs keymap is called `proof-mode-map').  To just affect one
prover, use a keymap name like `isar-mode-map' and evaluate after the
library `isar' has been loaded.

To find the names of the functions you may want to bind, look in this
manual, or query current bindings interactively with `C-h k'.  This
command (`describe-key') works for menu operations as well; also use it
to discover the current key-bindings which you're losing by
declarations such as those above.  By default, `C-n' is `next-line' and
`C-b' is `backward-char-command'; neither are really needed if you have
working cursor keys.

If your keyboard has a super modifier (on my PC keyboard it has a
Windows symbol and is next to the control key), you  can freely bind
keys on that modifier globally (since none are used by default).  Use
lisp like this:
     (global-set-key [?\s-l] 'maths-menu-insert-lambda)
     (global-set-key [?\s-l] 'maths-menu-insert-lambda)

     (global-set-key [?\s-l] 'maths-menu-insert-lambda)
     (global-set-key [?\s-L] 'maths-menu-insert-Lambda)
     (global-set-key [?\s-D] 'maths-menu-insert-Delta)

     (global-set-key [?\s-a] 'maths-menu-insert-for-all)
     (global-set-key [?\s-e] 'maths-menu-insert-there-exists)
     (global-set-key [?\s-t] 'maths-menu-insert-down-tack)
     (global-set-key [?\s-b] 'maths-menu-insert-up-tack)

     (global-set-key [?\s-\#] 'maths-menu-insert-music-sharp-sign)
     (global-set-key [?\s-\.] 'maths-menu-insert-horizontal-ellipsis)

     (global-set-key [?\s-3] 'proof-three-window-toggle)
This defines a bunch of short-cuts for inserting symbols taken from the
Maths Menu, *note Unicode symbols and special layout support:: and a
short-cut for enabling three window mode, *note Display customization::.


File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: Using file variables,  Next: Using abbreviations,  Prev: Adding your own keybindings,  Up: Hints and Tips

9.2 Using file variables
========================

A very convenient way to customize file-specific variables is to use
File Variables (*note (emacs)File Variables::). This feature of Emacs
permits to specify values for certain Emacs variables when a file is
loaded. File variables and their values are written as a list at the
end of the file.

For example, in Coq projects involving multiple directories, it is
necessary to set the variable `coq-load-path' (*note Customizing Coq
Multiple File Support::).  Here is an example: Assume the file
`.../dir/bar/foo.v' depends on modules in `.../dir/theories/'. Then you
can put the following at the end of `foo.v':

     (*
     *** Local Variables: ***
     *** coq-load-path: ("../theories") ***
     *** End: ***
     *)

This way, the right command line arguments are passed to the invocation
of `coqtop' when scripting starts in `foo.v'. Note that the load path
`"../theories"' is project or even file specific, and that therefore a
global setting via the configuration tool would be inappropriate.  With
file variables, Emacs will set `coq-load-path' automatically when
visiting `foo.v'. Moreover, the setting of `coq-load-path' in different
files or buffers will not be affected. (File variables become buffer
local.)

Extending the previous example, if the makefile for `foo.v' is located
in directory `.../dir/', you can add the right compile command. You can
also specify a "-R" command. And if you want a non standard coq
executable to be used, here is what you should put in variables:

     (*
     *** Local Variables: ***
     *** coq-prog-name: "../../coqsrc/bin/coqtop" ***
     *** coq-load-path: (("../util" "util") "../theories") ***
     *** compile-command: "make -C .. -k bar/foo.vo" ***
     *** End:***
     *)

And then the right call to make will be done if you use the `M-x
compile' command. Note that the lines are commented in order to be
ignored by the proof assistant. It is possible to use this mechanism for
all variables, *note (emacs)File Variables::.

One can also specify file variables on a per directory basis, *note
(emacs)Directory Variables::. For instance, assume you have a Coq
project with several subdirectories and you want to put each
subdirectory into `coq-load-path' for every file in the project. You
can achieve this by storing

     ((coq-mode . ((coq-load-path . ("../dir_1" "../dir_2" ... )))))

into the file `.dir-locals.el' in one of the parent directories. The
value in this file must be an alist that maps mode names to alists,
where these latter alists map variables to values, *note
(emacs)Directory Variables::.


File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: Using abbreviations,  Prev: Using file variables,  Up: Hints and Tips

9.3 Using abbreviations
=======================

A very useful package of Emacs supports automatic expansions of
abbreviations as you type, *note ((emacs))Abbrevs::.

For example, the proof assistant Coq has many command strings that are
long, such as "reflexivity," "Inductive," "Definition" and
"Discriminate."  Here is a part of the Coq Proof General abbreviations:
     "abs" "absurd "
     "ap" "apply "
     "as" "assumption"
The above list was taken from the file that Emacs saves between
sessions.  The easiest way to configure abbreviations is as you write,
by using the key presses `C-x a g' (`add-global-abbrev') or `C-x a i g'
(`inverse-add-global-abbrev').  To enable automatic expansion of
abbreviations (which can be annoying), the `Abbrev' minor mode, type
`M-x abbrev-mode RET'. When you are not in Abbrev mode you can expand
an abbreviation by pressing `C-x '' (`expand-abbrev'). See the Emacs
manual for more details.

Coq Proof General has a special experimental feature called "Holes"
which makes use of the abbreviation mechanism and includes a large list
of command abbreviations. *Note Holes feature::, for details.  With
other provers, you may use the standard Emacs commands above to set up
your own abbreviation tables.

10 LEGO Proof General
*********************

LEGO proof script mode is a mode derived from proof script mode for
editing LEGO scripts. An important convention is that proof script
buffers _must_ start with a module declaration. If the proof script
buffer's file name is `fermat.l', then it must commence with a
declaration of the form

     Module fermat;

If, in the development of the module `fermat', you require material
from other module e.g., `lib_nat' and `galois', you need to specify
this dependency as part of the module declaration:

     Module fermat Import lib_nat galois;

No need to worry too much about efficiency. When you retract back to a
module declaration to add a new import item, LEGO does not actually
retract the previously imported modules. Therefore, reasserting the
extended module declaration really only processes the newly imported
modules.

Using the LEGO Proof General, you never ever need to use administrative
LEGO commands such as `Forget', `ForgetMark', `KillRef', `Load',
`Make', `Reload' and `Undo' again (1).

In addition to the commands provided by the generic Proof General (as
discussed in the previous sections) the LEGO Proof General provides a
few extensions. In proof scripts, there are some abbreviations for
common commands:

`C-c C-a C-i'
     intros

`C-c C-a C-I'
     Intros

`C-c C-a C-R'

11.1 Coq-specific commands
==========================

Coq Proof General supplies the following key-bindings:
`C-c C-a C-i'
     Inserts "Intros "

`C-c C-a C-a'
     Inserts "Apply "

`C-c C-a C-s'
     Inserts "Section "

`C-c C-a C-e'
     Inserts "End <section-name>." (this should work well with nested
     sections).

`C-c C-a C-o'
     Prompts for a SearchIsos argument.

11.2 Multiple File Support
==========================

Since version 4.1 Coq Proof General has multiple file support. It
consists of the following points:

Restarting `coqtop' when changing the active scripting buffer
     Different buffers may require different load path' or different
     sets of `-I' options. Because Coq cannot undo changes in the load
     path, Proof General is forced to restart `coqtop' when the active
     scripting buffer changes.

Locking ancestors
     Locking those buffers on which the current active scripting buffer
     depends. This is controlled by the user option
     `coq-lock-ancestors', *note Customizing Coq Multiple File
     Support:: and *note Locking Ancestors::.

(Re-)Compilation
     Before a `Require' command is processed it may be necessary to
     save and compile some buffers. Because this feature conflicts with
     existing customization habits, it is switched off by default. When
     it is properly configured, one can freely switch between different
     buffers. Proof General will compile the necessary files whenever a
     `Require' command is processed.

     The compilation feature does currently not support ML modules.

The current version works reliably, even when stress-tested with
changing random files in large Coq projects. However, some features
have been spared for the next release, *note Current Limitations::.

To enable the automatic compilation feature there are three points to
adhere to:

   * The option `coq-compile-before-require' must be turned on (menu
     `Coq -> Settings -> Compile Before Require').

   * Nonstandard load path elements _must_ be configured in the option
     `coq-load-path'. `-I' options in `coq-prog-name' or
     `coq-prog-args' must be deleted.

   * In `coq-load-path' use strings `"dir"' for `-I' options and lists
     of two strings `("dir" "path")' for `-R "dir" -as "path"' (for
     more details see the documentation of `coq-load-path' or *note
     Customizing Coq Multiple File Support::).

   * For a nonstandard compilation procedure and limited ML module
     support, `coq-compile-command' can be set to an external
     compilation command. For standard dependency analysis with
     `coqdep' and compilation with `coqc' the option
     `coq-compile-command' can be left empty. In this case Proof
     General calls `coqdep' and `coqc' as needed.

File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: Automatic Compilation in Detail,  Next: Locking Ancestors,  Up: Multiple File Support

11.2.1 Automatic Compilation in Detail
--------------------------------------

When `coq-compile-before-require' is enabled, Proof General looks for
`Require' commands in text that gets asserted (i.e., in text that is
moved from the editing region to the queue region, *note Locked queue
and editing regions::). If Proof General finds a `Require' command, it
checks the dependencies and (re-)compiles files as necessary. Only after
this compilation is finished, Proof General starts sending the asserted
text to the Coq process.

`Declare ML Module' commands are currently not recognized.

Proof General uses `coqdep' in order to translate the qualified
identifiers in `Require' commands to coq library file names. Therefore,
in Coq version prior to `8.3pl2', `Require Arith' works, while `Require
Arith.Le' gives an error. The use of `coqdep' is also the reason why
nonstandard load path elements must be configured in `coq-load-path'.

Once the library file name has been determined, its dependencies must
be checked and out-of-date files must be compiled. This can either be
done internally, by Proof General itself, or by an external command. If
`coq-compile-command' is the empty string, Proof General does
dependency checking and compilation itself. Otherwise the command in
`coq-compile-command' is started as an external process after
substituting certain keys, *note Customizing Coq Multiple File
Support::.

For an external compilation command Proof General uses the general
compilation facilities of Emacs (*note (emacs)Compilation::) with its
own customization variables.  The compilation command must be
customized in `coq-compile-command' and the flag
`coq-confirm-external-compilation' (menu `Coq -> Settings -> Confirm
External Compilation') determines whether the user must confirm the
compilation command. The output of the compilation appears then in the
`*compilation*' buffer.

When Proof General compiles itself, output is only shown in case of
errors. It then appears in the buffer `*coq-compile-response*'. With
internal as well as with external compilation one can use `C-x `'
(bound to `next-error', *note (emacs)Compilation Mode::) to jump to
error locations.  Note however, that `coqdep' does not produce error
messages with location information, so `C-x `' cannot work for errors
from `coqdep'.

For simplicity, internal compilation is currently done with
synchronously running external commands. Therefore, for internal
compilation, Emacs is locked and unresponsive until the compilation
finishes.

Proof General cannot know if some library files have been updated
outside of Proof General, therefore, it must perform the dependency
checking for each `Require' command. If the continuous confirmation of
the external compilation commands becomes tedious, disable
`coq-confirm-external-compilation' (see menu `Coq -> Settings').

When a `Require' command causes a compilation of some files one may
wish to save some buffers to disk beforehand. The option
`coq-compile-auto-save' controls how and which files are saved. There
are two orthogonal choices: One may wish to save all or only the Coq
source files, and, one may or may not want to confirm the saving of
each file.


File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: Locking Ancestors,  Next: Customizing Coq Multiple File Support,  Prev: Automatic Compilation in Detail,  Up: Multiple File Support

11.2.2 Locking Ancestors
------------------------

Locking ancestor files works as a side effect of dependency checking.
This means that ancestor locking does only work when Proof General
performs dependency checking and compilation itself. If an external
command is used, Proof General does not see all dependencies and can
therefore only lock direct ancestors.

Currently, locking ancestor files might not exactly do what Coq users
expect. There are two ways around this problem: You can either switch
ancestor locking completely off via `coq-lock-ancestors' (*note
Customizing Coq Multiple File Support::) or you can generally permit
editing in locked sections with selecting `Proof-General' -> `Quick
Options' -> `Read Only' -> `Freely Edit' (which will set the option
`proof-strict-read-only' to `nil').

In the default setting, when you want to edit a locked ancestor, you are
forced to completely retract the current scripting buffer. The right
behaviour for Coq would be to retract the current scripting buffer only
up to the point before the appropriate `Require' command. At the users
choice it should also be possible to unlock the ancestor without
retracting the current scripting buffer. The latter would be adequate,
if you just want to add a lemma in the ancestor _and_ want to continue
the development in the current scripting buffer without interruption.

11.2.3 Customizing Coq Multiple File Support
--------------------------------------------

The customization settings for multiple file support of Coq Proof
General are in a separate customization group, the `coq-auto-compile'
group. To view all options in this group do `M-x customize-group
coq-auto-compile' or select menu entry `Proof-General -> Advanced ->
Customize -> Coq -> Coq Auto Compile -> Coq Auto Compile'.

 -- Variable: coq-compile-before-require
     If non-nil, check dependencies of required modules and compile if
     necessary.
     If non-nil ProofGeneral intercepts "Require" commands and checks
     if the required library module and its dependencies are
     up-to-date. If not, they are compiled from the sources before the
     "Require" command is processed.

     This option can be set/reset via menu `Coq -> Settings -> Compile
     Before Require'.

 -- Variable: coq-compile-auto-save
     Buffers to save before checking dependencies for compilation.
     There are two orthogonal choices: Firstly one can save all or only
     the coq buffers, where coq buffers means all buffers in coq mode
     except the current buffer. Secondly, Emacs can ask about each such
     buffer or save all of them unconditionally.

     This makes four permitted values: `'ask-coq' to confirm saving all
     modified Coq buffers, `'ask-all' to confirm saving all modified
     buffers, `'save-coq' to save all modified Coq buffers without
     confirmation and `'save-all' to save all modified buffers without
     confirmation.

The following two options deal with the load path. Proof General
divides the load path into the standard load path (which is hardwired
in the tools and need not be set explicitly), the nonstandard load path
(which must always be set explicitly), and the current directory (which
must be set explicitly for `coqdep'). The option `coq-load-path'
determines the nonstandard load path and `coq-load-path-include-current'
determines whether the current directory is put into the load path of
`coqdep'.

 -- Variable: coq-load-path
     Non-standard coq library load path.
     This list specifies the LoadPath extension for coqdep, coqc and
     coqtop. Usually, the elements of this list are strings (for "-I")
     or lists of two strings (for "-R" dir "-as" path).

     The possible forms of elements of this list correspond to the 3
     forms of include options ('-I' and `'-R''). An element can be
            - A string, specifying a directory to be mapped to the empty
              logical path ('-I').
            - A list of the form '(rec dir path)' (where dir and path are
              strings) specifying a directory to be recursively mapped to the
              logical path `'path'' ('-R dir -as path').
            - A list of the form '(norec dir path)', specifying a directory
              to be mapped to the logical path `'path'' ('-I dir -as path').
     For convenience the symbol `'rec'' can be omitted and entries of
     the form '(dir path)' are interpreted as '(rec dir path)'.

     Under normal circumstances this list does not need to contain the
     coq standard library or "." for the current directory (see
     ``coq-load-path-include-current'').

 -- Variable: coq-load-path-include-current
     If `t' let coqdep search the current directory too.
     Should be `t' for normal users. If `t' pass "-I dir" to coqdep when
     processing files in directory "dir" in addition to any entries in
     ``coq-load-path''.

The following two options configure an external compilation process.

 -- Variable: coq-compile-command
     External compilation command. If empty ProofGeneral compiles
     itself.
     If unset (the empty string) ProofGeneral computes the dependencies
     of required modules with coqdep and compiles as necessary. This
     internal dependency checking does currently not handle ML modules.

     If a non-empty string, the denoted command is called to do the
     dependency checking and compilation. Before executing this command
     the following keys are substituted as follows:
            %p  the (physical) directory containing the source of
                the required module
            %o  the Coq object file in the physical directory that will
                be loaded
            %s  the Coq source file in the physical directory whose
                object will be loaded
            %q  the qualified id of the "Require" command
            %r  the source file containing the "Require"
     For instance, "make -C %p %o" expands to "make -C bar foo.vo" when
     module "foo" from directory "bar" is required.

     After the substitution the command can be changed in the
     minibuffer if ``coq-confirm-external-compilation'' is t.

 -- Variable: coq-confirm-external-compilation
     If set let user change and confirm the compilation command.
     Otherwise start the external compilation without confirmation.

     This option can be set/reset via menu `Coq -> Settings -> Confirm
     External Compilation'.

Locking ancestors can be disabled with the following option.

 -- Variable: coq-lock-ancestors
     If non-nil, lock ancestor module files.
     If external compilation is used (via ``coq-compile-command'') then
     only the direct ancestors are locked. Otherwise all ancestors are
     locked when the "Require" command is processed.

The following option controls which warnings of `coqdep' are treated as
errors.

 -- Variable: coq-coqdep-error-regexp
     Regexp to match errors in the output of coqdep.
     coqdep indicates errors not always via a non-zero exit status, but
     sometimes only via printing warnings. This regular expression is
     used for recognizing error conditions in the output of coqdep
     (when coqdep terminates with exit status 0). Its default value
     matches the warning that some required library cannot be found on
     the load path and ignores the warning for finding a library at
     multiple places in the load path. If you want to turn the latter
     condition into an error, then set this variable to "^\*\*\*
     Warning".

The following two options do only influence the behaviour if Proof
General does dependency checking and compilation itself.  These options
determine whether Proof General should descend into other Coq libraries
and into the Coq standard library.

 -- Variable: coq-compile-ignored-directories
     Directories in which ProofGeneral should not compile modules.
     List of regular expressions for directories in which ProofGeneral
     should not compile modules. If a library file name matches one of
     the regular expressions in this list then ProofGeneral does
     neither compile this file nor check its dependencies for
     compilation. It makes sense to include non-standard coq library
     directories here if they are not changed and if they are so big
     that dependency checking takes noticeable time.

 -- Variable: coq-compile-ignore-library-directory
     If non-nil, ProofGeneral does not compile modules from the coq
     library.
     Should be `t' for normal coq users. If `nil' library modules are
     compiled if their sources are newer.

     This option has currently no effect, because Proof General uses
     coqdep to translate qualified identifiers into library file names
     and coqdep does not output dependencies in the standard library.

The last three Emacs constants are internal parameters. They only need
to be changed under very special, unforeseen circumstances.  They can
only be set in Emacs lisp code because they are no customizable user
options.

 -- Variable: coq-compile-substitution-list
     Substitutions for ``coq-compile-command''.
     Value must be a list of substitutions, where each substitution is
     a 2-element list. The first element of a substitution is the
     regexp to substitute, the second the replacement. The replacement
     is evaluated before passing it to ``replace-regexp-in-string'', so
     it might be a string, or one of the symbols `'physical-dir',
     `'module-object', `'module-source', `'qualified-id' and
     `'requiring-file', which are bound to, respectively, the physical
     directory containing the source file, the Coq object file in
     `'physical-dir' that will be loaded, the Coq source file in
     `'physical-dir' whose object will be loaded, the qualified module
     identifier that occurs in the "Require" command, and the file that
     contains the "Require".

 -- Variable: coq-require-command-regexp
     Regular expression matching Require commands in Coq.
     Should match "Require" with its import and export variants up to
     (but not including) the first character of the first required
     module. The required modules are matched separately with
     ``coq-require-id-regexp''

 -- Variable: coq-require-id-regexp
     Regular expression matching one Coq module identifier.
     Should match precisely one complete module identifier and
     surrounding white space. The module identifier must be matched
     with group number 1.  Note that the trailing dot in "Require A."
     is not part of the module identifier and should therefore not be
     matched by this regexp.

11.2.4 Current Limitations
--------------------------

In the current release some aspects of multiple file support have not
been implemented. The following points will hopefully addressed in the
next release:

   * Support `Declare ML Module' commands.

   * Improved undo behaviour for locked ancestors.

   * Use always asynchronous processes for compilation and do not lock
     up Emacs in internal compilation mode.

   * Increase precision when comparing modification times. Because of
     an Emacs limitation, modification time stamps of files have only a
     precision of 1 second. If several compiled Coq object files have
     been created in the same second, Proof General is optimistic and
     does not recompile. (Note that GNU make behaves the same on file
     systems that record time stamps only with a precision of 1 second.)


File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: Editing multiple proofs,  Next: User-loaded tactics,  Prev: Multiple File Support,  Up: Coq Proof General

11.3 Editing multiple proofs
============================

Coq allows the user to enter top-level commands while editing a proof
script.  For example, if the user realizes that the current proof will
fail without an additional axiom, he or she can add that axiom to the
system while in the middle of the proof.  Similarly, the user can nest
lemmas, beginning a new lemma while in the middle of an earlier one,
and as the lemmas are proved or their proofs aborted they are popped
off a stack.

Coq Proof General supports this feature of Coq.  Top-level commands
entered while in a proof are well backtracked. If new lemmas are
started, Coq Proof General lets the user work on the proof of the new
lemma, and when the lemma is finished it falls back to the previous
one.  This is supported to any nesting depth that Coq allows.

Warning! Using Coq commands for navigating inside the different proofs
(`Resume' and especially `Suspend') are not supported, backtracking
will break syncronization.

Special note: The old feature that moved nested proofs outside the
current proof is disabled.


File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: User-loaded tactics,  Next: Holes feature,  Prev: Editing multiple proofs,  Up: Coq Proof General

11.4 User-loaded tactics
========================

Another feature that Coq allows is the extension of the grammar of the
proof assistant by new tactic commands.  This feature interacts with the
proof script management of Proof General, because Proof General needs to
know when a tactic is called that alters the proof state.  When the user
tries to retract across an extended tactic in a script, the algorithm
for calculating how far to undo has a default behavior that is not
always accurate in proof mode: do "`Undo'".

Coq Proof General does not currently support dynamic tactic extension in
Coq: this is desirable but requires assistance from the Coq core.
Instead we provide a way to add tactic and command names in the
`.emacs' file. Four Configurable variables allows to register personal
new tactics and commands into four categories:
   * _state changing commands_, which need "`Back'" to be backtracked;

   * _state changing tactics_, which need "`Undo'" to be backtracked;

   * _state preserving commands_, which do not need to be backtracked;

   * _state preserving tactics_, which do not need to be backtracked;

We give an example of existing commands that fit each category.

   * `coq-user-state-preserving-commands': example: "`Print'"

   * `coq-user-state-changing-commands': example: "`Require'"

   * `coq-user-state-changing-tactics': example: "`Intro'"

   * `coq-user-state-preserving-tactics': example: "`Idtac'"

This variables are regexp string lists. See their documentations in
emacs (`C-h v coq-user...')  for details on how to set them in your
`.emacs' file.

Here is a simple example:
     (setq coq-user-state-changing-commands
           '("MyHint" "MyRequire"))
     (setq coq-user-state-preserving-commands
           '("Show\\s-+Mydata"))

The regexp character sequence `\\s-+' means "one or more whitespaces".
See the Emacs documentation of `regexp-quote' for the syntax and
semantics.  WARNING: you need to restart Emacs to make the changes to
these variables effective.

In case of losing synchronization, the user can use `C-c C-z' to move
the locked region to the proper position, (`proof-frob-locked-end',
*note Escaping script management::) or `C-c C-v' to re-issue an
erroneously back-tracked tactic without recording it in the script.


File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: Holes feature,  Next: Proof-Tree Visualization,  Prev: User-loaded tactics,  Up: Coq Proof General

11.5 Holes feature
==================

_Holes_ are an experimental feature for complex expression editing by
filling in templates. It is inspired from other tools, like Pcoq
(`http://www-sop.inria.fr/lemme/pcoq/index.html').  The principle is
simple, holes are pieces of text that can be "filled" by various means.
The Coq command insertion menu system makes use of the holes system.
Almost all holes operations are available in the Holes menu.

Notes: Holes make use of the Emacs abbreviation mechanism, it will work
without problem if you don't have an abbrev table defined for Coq in
your config files.  Use `C-h v abbrev-file-name' to see the name of the
abbreviation file.

If you already have such a table it won't be automatically overwritten
(so that you keep your own abbreviations).  But you must read the abbrev
file given in the Proof General sources to be able to use the command
insertion menus.  You can do the following to merge your abbreviations
with ProofGeneral's abbreviations: `M-x read-abbrev-file', then select
the file named `coq-abbrev.el' in the `ProofGeneral/coq' directory. At
Emacs exit you will be asked if you want to save abbrevs; answer yes.

11.6 Proof-Tree Visualization
=============================

Starting with Proof General version 4.2 and Coq version 8.4, Coq Proof
General has full support for proof-tree visualization, *note Graphical
Proof-Tree Visualization::.

Proof-tree visualization does currently neither support bullets and
braces nor the command "Grab Existential Variables".

For the visualization to work properly, proofs must be started with
"Proof.", which is encouraged practice anyway (see Coq Bug #2776).

12 Isabelle Proof General
*************************

Isabelle Proof General supports major generic features of Proof General,
including integration with Isabelle's theory loader for proper automatic
multiple file handling.

Isabelle provides its own way to invoke Proof General via the
`isabelle' command.  Running `isabelle emacs' starts an Emacs session
with Isabelle Proof General.  The defaults may be changed by editing
the Isabelle settings, see the Isabelle documentation for details.

Proof General for Isabelle manages Isar `.thy' files.  Proof General
provides reliable control over incremental execution of the text.

* Choosing logic and starting isabelle::
* Isabelle commands::
* Isabelle settings::
* Isabelle customizations::


File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: Choosing logic and starting isabelle,  Next: Isabelle commands,  Up: Isabelle Proof General

12.1 Choosing logic and starting isabelle
=========================================

When you load an Isabelle theory file into Proof General, you may be
prompted for the path to the program `isabelle' if it is not on the
system `PATH' already.  This is used to generate further information
for invoking Isabelle, in particular, the list of available logics.

The Isabelle menu offers an easy way to select the invoked object logic.
If you look at the menu:
             Isabelle -> Logics ->
you should see the list of logics available to Isabelle.  This menu is
generated from the output of the command `isabelle findlogics'.
(Similarly, the documentation menu is partly generated from `isabelle
doc').  Instead of the menu, you can use the keyboard command
`isabelle-chose-logic' to choose from the list.

The logics list is refreshed dynamically so you can select any newly
built heap images in the same Emacs session.  However, notice that the
choices are greyed out while Isabelle is actually runnning -- you can
only switch to a new logic if you first exit Isabelle (similarly to
Proof General, Isabelle operates with only one logic at a time).

Another way to set the logic before Isabelle is launched is using an
Emacs local variable setting inside a comment at the top of the file,
see the documentation of `isabelle-chosen-logic' below.

In case you do not have the `isabelle' program available or want to
override its behaviour, you may set the variable
`isabelle-program-name-override' to define the name of the executable
used to start Isabelle.  The standard options are and logic name are
still appended.

 -- User Option: isabelle-program-name-override
     Name of executable program to run Isabelle.

     You can set customize this in case the automatic settings
     mechanism does not work for you, perhaps because isabelle is not
     on your path, or you are running it remotely.

     The logic image name is tagged onto the end.

     The default value is `nil'.

 -- User Option: isabelle-chosen-logic
     Choice of logic to use with Isabelle.
     If non-nil, added onto the Isabelle command line for invoking
     Isabelle.

     You can set this as a file local variable, using a special comment
     at the top of your theory file, like this:
             (* -*- `isabelle-chosen-logic': "ZF" -*- *)

     The default value is `nil'.

 -- Command: isabelle-choose-logic logic
     Adjust isabelle-prog-name and `proof-prog-name' for running LOGIC.

Command termination via ``;'' is an optional feature of Isar syntax.
Neither Isabelle nor Proof General require semicolons to do their job.
The following command allows to get rid of command terminators in
existing texts.

 -- Command: isar-strip-terminators
     Remove explicit Isabelle/Isar command terminators `;' from the
     buffer.

12.3 Isabelle settings
======================

The Isabelle menu also contains a `Settings' submenu, which allows you
to configure things such as the behaviour of Isabelle's term pretty
printer (display of types, sorts, etc).  Note that you won't see this
sub-menu until Isabelle has been started, because it is generated by
Isabelle itself.  Proof General, on the other hand, is responsible for
recording any settings that are configured when you select `Isabelle ->
Settings -> Save Settings'.  They are stored along with the other Emacs
customization settings.

13 HOL Light Proof General
**************************

HOL Light Proof General is a "technology demonstration" of Proof General
for HOL Light.  This means that only a basic instantiation has been
provided, and that it is not yet supported as a maintained instantiation
of Proof General.

HOL Light Proof General has basic script management support, with a
little bit of decoration of scripts and output.  It does not rely on a
modified version of HOL Light, so the pattern matching may be fragile in
certain cases.

See the `example.ml' file for a demonstration proof script which works
with Proof General.

Note that HOL Light Proof Script proof scripts often use batch-oriented
single step tactic proofs, but Proof General does not (yet) offer an
easy way to edit these kind of proofs.  They will replay simply as a
single step proof and you will need to convert from the interactive to
batch form as usual if you wish to obtain batch proofs.  Also note that
Proof General does not contain an SML parser, so there can be problems
if you write complex ML in proof scripts.

HOL Light is the most recently tested version of HOL with Proof General,
but the Proof General distribution also contains experimental support
for HOL 4 (aka HOL 98).  To improve this older version, or to support a
new HOL variant, a few of the settings probably need to be tweaked to
cope with small differences in output between the systems.  Please let
us know if you try this out and want help.  We welcome any interested
collaborators from the HOL communities to help improve Proof General as
an interface for HOL provers.

14 Shell Proof General
**********************

This instance of Proof General is not really for proof assistants at
all, but simply provided as a handy way to use a degenerate form of
script management with other tools.

Suppose you have a software tool of some kind with a command line
interface, and you want to demonstrate several example uses of it,
perhaps at a conference.  But the command lines for your tool may be
quite complicated, so you do not want to type them in live.  Instead,
you just want to cut and paste from a pre-recorded list.  But watching
somebody cut and paste commands into a window is almost as tedious as
watching them type those commands!

Shell Proof General comes to the rescue.  Simply record your commands in
a file with the extension `.pgsh', and load up Proof General.  Now use
the toolbar to send each line of the file to your tool, and have the
output displayed clearly in another window.  Much easier and more
pleasant for your audience to watch!

If you wish, you may adjust the value of `proof-prog-name' in
`pgshell.el' to launch your program rather than the shell interpreter.

We welcome feedback and suggestions concerning this subsidiary provision
in Proof General.  Please recommend it to your colleagues (e.g., the
model checking crew).

A.1 Obtaining Proof General
===========================

You can obtain Proof General from the URL
     `http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk'.

The distribution is available in as a tarball.  It may be redistributed
by third party packagers in other forms.

Two versions are available:
   * The current stable version,
     `http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/ProofGeneral-stable.tgz'

   * The latest development version,
     `http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/ProofGeneral-latest.tgz'

The source tarball includes the generic elisp code, and code for LEGO,
Coq, Isabelle, and other provers.  Also included are installation
instructions (reproduced in brief below) and this documentation.

For access to the source code repository, please see the Proof General
web page `http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/devel'.

A.2 Installing Proof General from tarball
=========================================

Copy the distribution to some directory MYDIR.  Unpack it there. For
example:
     # cd MYDIR
     # tar -xpzf ProofGeneral-VERSION.tgz
If you downloaded the version called LATEST, you'll find it unpacks to
a numeric version number.

Proof General will now be in some subdirectory of MYDIR.  The name of
the subdirectory will depend on the version number of Proof General.
For example, it might be `ProofGeneral-4.0'.  It's convenient to link
it to a fixed name:
     # ln -sf ProofGeneral-4.0 ProofGeneral
Now put this line in your `.emacs' file:
         (load-file "MYDIR/ProofGeneral/generic/proof-site.el")


File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: Setting the names of binaries,  Next: Notes for syssies,  Prev: Installing Proof General from tarball,  Up: Obtaining and Installing

A.3 Setting the names of binaries
=================================

The `load-file' command you have added will load `proof-site' which
sets the Emacs load path for Proof General and add auto-loads and modes
for the supported assistants.

The default names for proof assistant binaries may work on your system.
If not, you will need to set the appropriate variables.  The easiest way
to do this (and most other customization of Proof General) is via the
Customize mechanism, see the menu item:
       Proof-General -> Advanced -> Customize -> NAME OF ASSISTANT -> Prog Name
The Proof-General menu is available from script buffers after Proof
General is loaded.  To load it manually, type
       M-x load-library RET proof RET

If you do not want to use customize, simply add a line like this:
       (setq coq-prog-name "/usr/bin/coqtop -emacs")
to your `.emacs' file.

A.4 Notes for syssies
=====================

Here are some more notes for installing Proof General in more complex
ways.  Only attempt things in this section if you really understand what
you're doing!

Byte compilation
----------------

Compilation of the Emacs lisp files improves efficiency but can
sometimes cause compatibility problems, especially if you use more than
one version of Emacs with the same `.elc' files.

If you discover problems using the byte-compiled `.elc' files which
aren't present using the source `.el' files, please report them to us.

You can compile Proof General by typing `make' in the directory where
you installed it.  It may be necessary to do this if you use a
different version of Emacs.

Site-wide installation
----------------------

If you are installing Proof General site-wide, you can put the
components in the standard directories of the filesystem if you prefer,
providing the variables in `proof-site.el' are adjusted accordingly
(see Proof General site configuration in Adapting Proof General for
more details).  Make sure that the `generic/' and assistant-specific
elisp files are kept in subdirectories (`coq/', `isa/', `lego/') of
`proof-home-directory' so that the autoload directory calculations are
correct.

To prevent every user needing to edit their own `.emacs' files, you can
put the `load-file' command to load `proof-site.el' into
`site-start.el' or similar.  Consult the Emacs documentation for more
details if you don't know where to find this file.

Removing support for unwanted provers
-------------------------------------

You cannot run more than one instance of Proof General at a time: so if
you're using Coq, visiting an `.ML' file will not load Isabelle Proof
General, and the buffer remains in fundamental mode.  If there are some
assistants supported that you never want to use, you can adjust the
variable `proof-assistants' in `proof-site.el' to remove the extra
autoloads.  This is advisable in case the extensions clash with other
Emacs modes, for example Verilog mode for `.v' files clashes with Coq
mode.

See Proof General site configuration in Adapting Proof General, for
more details of how to adjust the `proof-assistants' setting.

Instead of altering `proof-assistants', a simple way to disable support
for some prover is to delete the relevant directories from the PG
installation.  For example, to remove support for Coq, delete the `coq'
directory in the Proof General home directory.

History of Proof General
************************

It all started some time in 1994. There was no Emacs interface for LEGO.
Back then, Emacs militants worked directly with the Emacs shell to
interact with the LEGO system.

David Aspinall convinced Thomas Kleymann that programming in Emacs Lisp
wasn't so difficult after all. In fact, Aspinall had already
implemented an Emacs interface for Isabelle with bells and whistles,
called Isamode (http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/da/Isamode). Soon after,
the package `lego-mode' was born. Users were able to develop proof
scripts in one buffer. Support was provided to automatically send parts
of the script to the proof process. The last official version with the
name `lego-mode' (1.9) was released in May 1995.

The interface project really took off the ground in November 1996. Yves
Bertot had been working on a sophisticated user interface for the Coq
system (CtCoq) based on the generic environment Centaur. He visited the
Edinburgh LEGO group for a week to transfer proof-by-pointing
technology. Even though proof-by-pointing is an inherently
structure-conscious algorithm, within a week, Yves Bertot, Dilip
Sequeira and Thomas Kleymann managed to implement a first prototype of
proof-by-pointing in the Emacs interface for LEGO [BKS97].

Perhaps we could reuse even more of the CtCoq system. It being a
structure editor did no longer seem to be such an obstacle. Moreover,
to conveniently use proof-by-pointing in actual developments, one would
need better support for script management.

In 1997, Dilip Sequeira implemented script management in our Emacs
interface for LEGO following the recipe in [BT98]. Inspired by the
project CROAP, the implementation made some effort to be generic. A
working prototype was demonstrated at UITP'97.

In October 1997, Healfdene Goguen ported `lego-mode' to Coq. Part of
the generic code in the `lego' package was outsourced (and made more
generic) in a new package called `proof'. Dilip Sequeira provided some
LEGO-specific support for handling multiple files and wrote a few
manual pages. The system was reasonably robust and we shipped out the
package to friends.

In June 1998, David Aspinall reentered the picture by providing an
instantiation for Isabelle. Actually, our previous version wasn't quite
as generic as we had hoped. Whereas LEGO and Coq are similar systems in
many ways, Isabelle was really a different beast. Fierce re-engineering
and various usability improvements were provided by Aspinall and
Kleymann to make it easier to instantiate to new proof systems. The
major technical improvement was a truly generic extension of script
management to work across multiple files.

It was time to come up with a better name than just `proof' mode.
David Aspinall suggested _Proof General_ and set about reorganizing the
file structure to disentangle the Proof General project from LEGO at
last.  He cooked up some images and bolted on a toolbar, so a naive
user can replay proofs without knowing a proof assistant language or
even Emacs hot-keys.  He also designed some web pages, and wrote most
of this manual.

Despite views of some detractors, we demonstrated that an interface
both friendly and powerful can be built on top of Emacs.  Proof General
2.0 was the first official release of the improved program, made in
December 1998.

Version 2.1 was released in August 1999.  It was used at the Types
Summer School held in Giens, France in September 1999 (see
`http://www-sop.inria.fr/types-project/types-sum-school.html').  About
50 students learning Coq, Isabelle, and LEGO used Proof General for all
three systems.  This experience provided invaluable feedback and
encouragement to make the improvements that went into Proof General 3.0.

Old News for 3.0
================

Proof General 3.0 (released November 1999) has many improvements over
2.x releases.

First, there are usability improvements.  The toolbar was somewhat
impoverished before.  It now has twice as many buttons, and includes all
of the useful functions used during proof which were previously hidden
on the menu, or even only available as key-presses.  Key-bindings have
been re-organized, users of previous versions may notice.  The menu has
been redesigned and coordinated with the toolbar, and now gives easy
access to more of the features of Proof General.  Previously several
features were only likely to be discovered by those keen enough to read
this manual!

Second, there are improvements, extensions, and bug fixes in the generic
basis. Proofs which are unfinished and not explicitly closed by a
"save" type command are supported by the core, if they are allowed by
the prover.  The design of switching the active scripting buffer has
been streamlined.  The management of the queue of commands waiting to be
sent to the shell has been improved, so there are fewer unnecessary
"Proof Process Busy!" messages.  The support for scripting with multiple
files was improved so that it behaves reliably with Isabelle99; file
reading messages can be communicated in both directions now.  The proof
shell filter has been optimized to give hungry proof assistants a better
share of CPU cycles.  Proof-by-pointing has been resurrected; even
though LEGO's implementation is incomplete, it seems worth maintaining
the code in Proof General so that the implementors of other proof
assistants are encouraged to provide support.  For one example, we can
certainly hope for support in Coq, since the CtCoq proof-by-pointing
code has been moved into the Coq kernel lately.  We need a volunteer
from the Coq community to help to do this.

An important new feature in Proof General 3.0 is support for X-Symbol
(http://x-symbol.sourceforge.net/), which means that real logical
symbols, Greek letters, etc can be displayed during proof development,
instead of their ASCII approximations. This makes Proof General a more
serious competitor to native graphical user interfaces.

Finally, Proof General has become much easier to adapt to new provers
-- it fails gracefully (or not at all!) when particular configuration
variables are unset, and provides more default settings which work
out-of-the-box.  An example configuration for Isabelle is provided,
which uses just 25 or so simple settings.

This manual has been updated and extended for Proof General 3.0.
Amongst other improvements, it has a better description of how to add
support for a new prover.

See the `CHANGES' file in the distribution for more information about
the latest improvements in Proof General.  Developers should check the
`ChangeLog' in the developer's release for detailed comments on
internal changes.

Most of the work for Proof General 3.0 has been done by David Aspinall.
Markus Wenzel helped with Isabelle support, and provided invaluable
feedback and testing, especially for the improvements to multiple file
handling.  Pierre Courtieu took responsibility from Patrick Loiseleur
for Coq support, although improvements in both Coq and LEGO instances
for this release were made by David Aspinall.  Markus Wenzel provided
support for his Isar language, a new proof language for Isabelle.  David
von Oheimb helped to develop the generic version of his X-Symbol
addition which he originally provided for Isabelle.

A new instantiation of Proof General is being worked on for _Plastic_,
a proof assistant being developed at the University of Durham.

Old News for 3.1
================

Proof General 3.1 (released March 2000) is a bug-fix improvement over
version 3.0.  There are some minor cosmetic improvements, but large
changes have been held back to ensure stability.  This release solves a
few minor problems which came to light since the final testing stages
for 3.0.  It also solves some compatibility problems, so now it works
with various versions of Emacs which we hadn't tested with before
(non-mule GNU Emacs, certain Japanese Emacs versions).

We're also pleased to announce HOL Proof General, a new instance of
Proof General for HOL98.  This is supplied as a "technology
demonstration" for HOL users in the hope that somebody from the HOL
community will volunteer to adopt it and become a maintainer and
developer.  (Otherwise, work on HOL Proof General will not continue).

Apart from that there are a few other small improvements.  Check the
CHANGES file in the distribution for full details.

The HOL98 support and much of the work on Proof General 3.1 was
undertaken by David Aspinall while he was visiting ETL, Osaka, Japan,
supported by the British Council and ETL.


File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: Old News for 3.2,  Next: Old News for 3.3,  Prev: Old News for 3.1,  Up: History of Proof General

Old News for 3.2
================

Proof General 3.2 introduced several new features and some bug fixes.
One noticeable new feature is the addition of a prover-specific menu for
each of the supported provers.  This menu has a "favourites" feature
that you can use to easily define new functions.  Please contribute
other useful functions (or suggestions) for things you would like to
appear on these menus.

Because of the new menus and to make room for more commands, we have
made a new key map for prover specific functions.  These now all begin
with `C-c C-a'.  This has changed a few key bindings slightly.

Another new feature is the addition of prover-specific completion
tables, to encourage the use of Emacs's completion facility, using
`C-RET'.  *Note Support for completion::, for full details.

A less obvious new feature is support for turning the proof assistant
output on and off internally, to improve efficiency when processing
large scripts.  This means that more of your CPU cycles can be spent on
proving theorems.

Adapting for new proof assistants continues to be made more flexible,
and easier in several places.  This has been motivated by adding
experimental support for some new systems.  One new system which had
good support added in a very short space of time is PhoX (see the PhoX
home page (http://www.lama.univ-savoie.fr/~RAFFALLI/af2.html) for more
information).  PhoX joins the rank of officially supported Proof
General instances, thanks to its developer Christophe Raffalli.

Breaking the manual into two pieces was overdue: now all details on
adapting Proof General, and notes on its internals, are in the Adapting
Proof General manual.  You should find a copy of that second manual
close to wherever you found this one; consult the Proof General home
page if in doubt.

The internal code of Proof General has been significantly overhauled for
this version, which should make it more robust and readable.  The
generic code has an improved file structure, and there is support for
automatic generation of autoload functions.  There is also a new
mechanism for defining prover-specific customization and instantiation
settings which fits better with the customize library.  These settings
are named in the form `PA-setting-name' in the documentation; you
replace PA by the symbol for the proof assistant you are interested in.
*Note Customizing Proof General::, for details.

Finally, important bug fixes include the robustification against
`write-file' (`C-x C-w'), `revert-buffer', and friends.  These are
rather devious functions to use during script management, but Proof
General now tries to do the right thing if you're deviant enough to try
them out!

Work on this release was undertaken by David Aspinall between
May-September 2000, and includes contributions from Markus Wenzel,
Pierre Courtieu, and Christophe Raffalli.  Markus added some Isar
documentation to this manual.

Old News for 3.3
================

Proof General 3.3 includes a few feature additions, but mainly the focus
has been on compatibility improvements for new versions of provers (in
particular, Coq 7), and new versions of emacs (in particular, XEmacs
21.4).

One new feature is control over visibility of completed proofs, *Note
Visibility of completed proofs::.  Another new feature is the tracking
of theorem dependencies inside Isabelle.  A context-sensitive menu
(right-button on proof scripts) provides facility for browsing the
ancestors and child theorems of a theorem, and highlighting them.  The
idea of this feature is that it can help you untangle and rearrange big
proof scripts, by seeing which parts are interdependent.  The
implementation is provisional and not documented yet in the body of
this manual.  It only works for the "classic" version of Isabelle99-2.


File: ProofGeneral.info,  Node: Old News for 3.4,  Next: Old News for 3.5,  Prev: Old News for 3.3,  Up: History of Proof General

Old News for 3.4
================

Proof General 3.4 adds improvements and also compatibility fixes for
new versions of Emacs, in particular, for GNU Emacs 21, which adds the
remaining pretty features that have only been available to XEmacs users
until now (the toolbar and X-Symbol support).

One major improvement has been to provide better support for
synchronization with Coq proof scripts; now Coq Proof General should be
able to retract and replay most Coq proof scripts reliably.  Credit is
due to Pierre Courtieu, who also updated the documentation in this
manual.

As of version 3.4, Proof General is distributed under the GNU General
Public License (GPL).  Compared with the previous more restrictive
license, this means the program can now be redistributed by third
parties, and used in any context without applying for a special
license.  Despite these legal changes, we would still appreciate if you
send us back any useful improvements you make to Proof General, and
register your use of Proof General on the web site.

Old News for 3.7
================

Proof General version 3.7.1 is an updated and enhanced version of Proof
General 3.7.  See  `CHANGES' for more details.

Proof General version 3.7 collects together a cummulative set of
improvements to Proof General 3.5.  There are compatibility fixes for
newer Emacs versions, and particularly for GNU Emacs: credit is due to
Stefan Monnier for an intense period of debugging and patching.  The
options menu has been simplified and extended, and the display
management is improved and repaired for Emacs API changes.  There are
some other usability improvements, some after feedback from use at TYPES
Summer Schools.  Many new features have been added to enhance Coq mode
(thanks to Pierre Courtieu) and several improvements made for Isabelle
(thanks to Makarius Wenzel, Stefan Berghofer and Tjark Weber).

Support has been added for the useful Emacs packages Speedbar and Index
Menu, both usually distributed with Emacs.  Compatible versions of the
Emacs packages Math-Menu (for Unicode symbols) and MMM Mode (for
multiple modes in one buffer) are bundled with Proof General.  An
experimental Unicode Tokens package has been added which will replace
X-Symbol.

See the `CHANGES' file in the distribution for more complete details of
changes since version 3.5, and the appendix *note History of Proof
General:: for old news.
