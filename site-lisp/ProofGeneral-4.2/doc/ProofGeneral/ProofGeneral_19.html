<a name="index-history"></a>

<p>It all started some time in 1994. There was no Emacs interface for LEGO.
Back then, Emacs militants worked directly with the Emacs shell to
interact with the LEGO system. 
</p>
<p>David Aspinall convinced Thomas Kleymann that programming in
Emacs Lisp wasn&rsquo;t so difficult after all. In fact, Aspinall had already
implemented an Emacs interface for Isabelle with bells and whistles,
called <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/da/Isamode">Isamode</a>. Soon
after, the package <code>lego-mode</code> was born. Users were able to develop
proof scripts in one buffer. Support was provided to automatically send
parts of the script to the proof process. The last official version with
the name <code>lego-mode</code> (1.9) was released in May 1995.
</p>

<a name="index-proof-by-pointing-1"></a>
<a name="index-CtCoq"></a>
<a name="index-Centaur"></a>
<p>The interface project really took off the ground in November 1996. Yves
Bertot had been working on a sophisticated user interface for the Coq
system (CtCoq) based on the generic environment Centaur. He visited the
Edinburgh LEGO group for a week to transfer proof-by-pointing
technology. Even though proof-by-pointing is an inherently
structure-conscious algorithm, within a week, Yves Bertot, Dilip Sequeira 
and Thomas Kleymann managed to implement a first prototype of
proof-by-pointing in the Emacs interface for LEGO [BKS97].
</p>
<a name="index-structure-editor"></a>
<a name="index-script-management"></a>

<p>Perhaps we could reuse even more of the CtCoq system. It being a
structure editor did no longer seem to be such an obstacle. Moreover,
to conveniently use proof-by-pointing in actual developments, one would
need better support for script management.
</p>
<a name="index-generic"></a>
<p>In 1997, Dilip Sequeira implemented script management in our Emacs
interface for LEGO following the recipe in
[BT98]. Inspired by the project CROAP, the
implementation made some effort to be generic. A working prototype was
demonstrated at UITP&rsquo;97.  
</p>
<p>In October 1997, Healfdene Goguen ported <code>lego-mode</code> to Coq. Part
of the generic code in the <code>lego</code> package was outsourced (and made
more generic) in a new package called <code>proof</code>. Dilip Sequeira
provided some LEGO-specific support for handling multiple files and
wrote a few manual pages. The system was reasonably robust and we
shipped out the package to friends.
</p>
<p>In June 1998, David Aspinall reentered the picture by providing an
instantiation for Isabelle. Actually, our previous version wasn&rsquo;t quite
as generic as we had hoped. Whereas LEGO and Coq are similar systems in
many ways, Isabelle was really a different beast. Fierce re-engineering
and various usability improvements were provided by Aspinall and
Kleymann to make it easier to instantiate to new proof systems. The
major technical improvement was a truly generic extension of script
management to work across multiple files.
</p>
<p>It was time to come up with a better name than just <code>proof</code> mode.
David Aspinall suggested <em>Proof General</em> and set about
reorganizing the file structure to disentangle the Proof General
project from LEGO at last.  He cooked up some images and bolted on a
toolbar, so a naive user can replay proofs without knowing a proof
assistant language or even Emacs hot-keys.  He also designed some web
pages, and wrote most of this manual.  
</p>
<p>Despite views of some detractors, we demonstrated that an interface
both friendly and powerful can be built on top of Emacs.  Proof
General 2.0 was the first official release of the improved program,
made in December 1998.
</p>
<p>Version 2.1 was released in August 1999.  It was used at the Types
Summer School held in Giens, France in September 1999 (see
<a href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/types-project/types-sum-school.html">http://www-sop.inria.fr/types-project/types-sum-school.html</a>).
About 50 students learning Coq, Isabelle, and LEGO used Proof General
for all three systems.  This experience provided invaluable feedback and
encouragement to make the improvements that went into Proof General 3.0.

<h2 class="unnumberedsec">Old News for 3.0</h2>

<p>Proof General 3.0 (released November 1999) has many improvements over
2.x releases.
</p>
<p>First, there are usability improvements.  The toolbar was somewhat
impoverished before.  It now has twice as many buttons, and includes all
of the useful functions used during proof which were previously hidden
on the menu, or even only available as key-presses.  Key-bindings have
been re-organized, users of previous versions may notice.  The menu has
been redesigned and coordinated with the toolbar, and now gives easy
access to more of the features of Proof General.  Previously several
features were only likely to be discovered by those keen enough to read
this manual!
</p>
<p>Second, there are improvements, extensions, and bug fixes in the generic
basis. Proofs which are unfinished and not explicitly closed by a
&ldquo;save&rdquo; type command are supported by the core, if they are allowed by
the prover.  The design of switching the active scripting buffer has
been streamlined.  The management of the queue of commands waiting to be
sent to the shell has been improved, so there are fewer unnecessary
&quot;Proof Process Busy!&quot; messages.  The support for scripting with multiple
files was improved so that it behaves reliably with Isabelle99; file
reading messages can be communicated in both directions now.  The proof
shell filter has been optimized to give hungry proof assistants a better
share of CPU cycles.  Proof-by-pointing has been resurrected; even
though LEGO&rsquo;s implementation is incomplete, it seems worth maintaining
the code in Proof General so that the implementors of other proof
assistants are encouraged to provide support.  For one example, we can
certainly hope for support in Coq, since the CtCoq proof-by-pointing
code has been moved into the Coq kernel lately.  We need a volunteer
from the Coq community to help to do this.
</p>
<p>An important new feature in Proof General 3.0 is support for
<a href="http://x-symbol.sourceforge.net/">X-Symbol</a>, 
which means that real logical symbols, Greek letters,
etc can be displayed during proof development, instead of their ASCII
approximations. This makes Proof General a more serious competitor to
native graphical user interfaces.  
</p>
<p>Finally, Proof General has become much easier to adapt to new provers
&mdash; it fails gracefully (or not at all!) when particular configuration
variables are unset, and provides more default settings which work
out-of-the-box.  An example configuration for Isabelle is provided,
which uses just 25 or so simple settings.
</p>
<p>This manual has been updated and extended for Proof General 3.0.
Amongst other improvements, it has a better description of how to add
support for a new prover.
</p>
<p>See the <code>CHANGES</code> file in the distribution for more information
about the latest improvements in Proof General.  Developers should check
the <code>ChangeLog</code> in the developer&rsquo;s release for detailed comments on
internal changes.
</p>
<p>Most of the work for Proof General 3.0 has been done by David Aspinall.
Markus Wenzel helped with Isabelle support, and provided invaluable
feedback and testing, especially for the improvements to multiple file
handling.  Pierre Courtieu took responsibility from Patrick Loiseleur
for Coq support, although improvements in both Coq and LEGO instances
for this release were made by David Aspinall.  Markus Wenzel provided
support for his Isar language, a new proof language for Isabelle.  David
von Oheimb helped to develop the generic version of his X-Symbol
addition which he originally provided for Isabelle.
</p>
<p>A new instantiation of Proof General is being worked on for
<em>Plastic</em>, a proof assistant being developed at the University of
Durham.

<h2 class="unnumberedsec">Old News for 3.1</h2>
<a name="index-news-3"></a>

<p>Proof General 3.1 (released March 2000) is a bug-fix improvement over
version 3.0.  There are some minor cosmetic improvements, but large
changes have been held back to ensure stability.  This release solves a
few minor problems which came to light since the final testing stages
for 3.0.  It also solves some compatibility problems, so now it works
with various versions of Emacs which we hadn&rsquo;t tested with before
(non-mule GNU Emacs, certain Japanese Emacs versions).
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also pleased to announce HOL Proof General, a new instance of
Proof General for HOL98.  This is supplied as a &quot;technology
demonstration&quot; for HOL users in the hope that somebody from the HOL
community will volunteer to adopt it and become a maintainer and
developer.  (Otherwise, work on HOL Proof General will not continue).
</p>
<p>Apart from that there are a few other small improvements.  Check the
CHANGES file in the distribution for full details.
</p>
<p>The HOL98 support and much of the work on Proof General 3.1 was
undertaken by David Aspinall while he was visiting ETL, Osaka, Japan,
supported by the British Council and ETL.

<h2 class="unnumberedsec">Old News for 3.2</h2>
<a name="index-news-4"></a>

<p>Proof General 3.2 introduced several new features and some bug fixes.
One noticeable new feature is the addition of a prover-specific menu for
each of the supported provers.  This menu has a &ldquo;favourites&rdquo; feature
that you can use to easily define new functions.  Please contribute
other useful functions (or suggestions) for things you
would like to appear on these menus.
</p>
<p>Because of the new menus and to make room for more commands, we have
made a new key map for prover specific functions.  These now all begin
with <kbd>C-c C-a</kbd>.  This has changed a few key bindings slightly.
</p>
<p>Another new feature is the addition of prover-specific completion
tables, to encourage the use of Emacs&rsquo;s completion facility, using
<kbd>C-RET</kbd>.  See section <a href="ProofGeneral_6.html#Support-for-completion">Support for completion</a>, for full details.
</p>
<p>A less obvious new feature is support for turning the proof assistant
output on and off internally, to improve efficiency when processing
large scripts.  This means that more of your CPU cycles can be spent on
proving theorems.
</p>
<p>Adapting for new proof assistants continues to be made more flexible,
and easier in several places.  This has been motivated by adding
experimental support for some new systems.  One new system which had
good support added in a very short space of time is <b>PhoX</b> (see
<a href="http://www.lama.univ-savoie.fr/~RAFFALLI/af2.html">the PhoX home page</a> for more information).  PhoX joins the rank of officially
supported Proof General instances, thanks to its developer Christophe
Raffalli.
</p>
<p>Breaking the manual into two pieces was overdue: now all details on
adapting Proof General, and notes on its internals, are in the
<i>Adapting Proof General</i> manual.  You should find a copy of that
second manual close to wherever you found this one; consult the
Proof General home page if in doubt.
</p>
<p>The internal code of Proof General has been significantly overhauled for
this version, which should make it more robust and readable.  The
generic code has an improved file structure, and there is support for
automatic generation of autoload functions.  There is also a new
mechanism for defining prover-specific customization and instantiation
settings which fits better with the customize library.  These settings
are named in the form <code><i>PA</i>-setting-name</code> in the documentation;
you replace <i>PA</i> by the symbol for the proof assistant you are
interested in.  See section <a href="ProofGeneral_9.html#Customizing-Proof-General">Customizing Proof General</a>, for details.
</p>
<p>Finally, important bug fixes include the robustification against
<code>write-file</code> (<kbd>C-x C-w</kbd>), <code>revert-buffer</code>, and friends.
These are rather devious functions to use during script management, but
Proof General now tries to do the right thing if you&rsquo;re deviant enough
to try them out!
</p>
<p>Work on this release was undertaken by David Aspinall between
May-September 2000, and includes contributions from Markus Wenzel,
Pierre Courtieu, and Christophe Raffalli.  Markus added some Isar
documentation to this manual.

<a name="Old-News-for-3_002e3-1"></a>
<h2 class="unnumberedsec">Old News for 3.3</h2>

<p>Proof General 3.3 includes a few feature additions, but mainly the focus
has been on compatibility improvements for new versions of provers (in
particular, Coq 7), and new versions of emacs (in particular, XEmacs
21.4).
</p>
<p>One new feature is control over visibility of completed proofs,
See section <a href="ProofGeneral_4.html#Visibility-of-completed-proofs">Visibility of completed proofs</a>.  Another new feature is the
tracking of theorem dependencies inside Isabelle.  A context-sensitive
menu (right-button on proof scripts) provides facility for browsing the
ancestors and child theorems of a theorem, and highlighting them.  The
idea of this feature is that it can help you untangle and rearrange big
proof scripts, by seeing which parts are interdependent.  The implementation
is provisional and not documented yet in the body of this manual.  It only
works for the &quot;classic&quot; version of Isabelle99-2.
</p>

<a name="Old-News-for-3_002e4"></a>
<a name="Old-News-for-3_002e4-1"></a>
<h2 class="unnumberedsec">Old News for 3.4</h2>

<p>Proof General 3.4 adds improvements and also compatibility fixes for
new versions of Emacs, in particular, for GNU Emacs 21, which adds
the remaining pretty features that have only been available to XEmacs
users until now (the toolbar and X-Symbol support).
</p>
<p>One major improvement has been to provide better support for
synchronization with Coq proof scripts; now Coq Proof General should
be able to retract and replay most Coq proof scripts reliably.  Credit
is due to Pierre Courtieu, who also updated the documentation in this
manual.
</p>
<p>As of version 3.4, Proof General is distributed under the GNU General
Public License (GPL).  Compared with the previous more restrictive
license, this means the program can now be redistributed by third
parties, and used in any context without applying for a special
license.  Despite these legal changes, we would still appreciate if
you send us back any useful improvements you make to Proof General,
and register your use of Proof General on the web site.

<p>Proof General version 3.7.1 is an updated and enhanced version
of Proof General 3.7.  See  &lsquo;<tt>CHANGES</tt>&rsquo; for more details.
</p>
<p>Proof General version 3.7 collects together a cummulative set of
improvements to Proof General 3.5.  There are compatibility fixes for
newer Emacs versions, and particularly for GNU Emacs: credit is due to
Stefan Monnier for an intense period of debugging and patching.  The
options menu has been simplified and extended, and the display
management is improved and repaired for Emacs API changes.  There are
some other usability improvements, some after feedback from use at TYPES
Summer Schools.  Many new features have been added to enhance Coq mode
(thanks to Pierre Courtieu) and several improvements made for Isabelle
(thanks to Makarius Wenzel, Stefan Berghofer and Tjark Weber).
</p>
<p>Support has been added for the useful Emacs packages Speedbar
and Index Menu, both usually distributed with Emacs.  Compatible
versions of the Emacs packages Math-Menu (for Unicode symbols) and MMM
Mode (for multiple modes in one buffer) are bundled with Proof General.
An experimental Unicode Tokens package has been added which will replace
X-Symbol.
