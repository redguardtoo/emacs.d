Compatibility of Proof General
==============================

This version of Proof General has been tested with these Emacs versions
on recent Linux systems:

 Emacs 23.4             -- recommended and supported
 Emacs 23.3,23.2        -- previous versions, should work
 Emacs 24 (development) -- next version, should work
 Emacs 23.1, earlier    -- obsolete versions, do NOT work

and (main) prover versions:  Coq 8.3, Isabelle2011[-1]

See below for notes about other operating systems.

Maintaining compatibility across proof assistant versions, Emacs
versions and operating systems is virtually impossible.  

In the major 4.0 release ** XEmacs compatibility was dropped **


Running on Mac OS X
-------------------

For tips, please see here:

   http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/wiki/PGEmacsOnMacOSX

We recommend the 23.2 build of GNU Emacs, which builds natively on Mac
OS X (based on the NextStep port).  Binaries are available at various
websites (e.g., http://emacsformacosx.com), or you can build your own
by compiling from the FSF CVS. See the Emacs Wiki at
http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsForMacOS for more.

Note that Mac compatibility isn't thoroughly tested.  If you discover
problems, please send a report and/or fix to the PG trac.  Please
add tips to the wiki page above.


Running on Windows
------------------

For tips, please see here:

   http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/wiki/PGEmacsOnWindows

We recommend EmacsW32 available at:

   http://www.ourcomments.org/Emacs/EmacsW32.html

Unpack the Proof General tar or zip file, and rename the folder to
"ProofGeneral" to remove the version number.  Put a line like this:

   (load-file "c:\\ProofGeneral\\generic\\proof-site.el")

into .emacs.  You should put .emacs in value of HOME if you set that,
or else in directory you installled Emacs in, e.g.  
c:\Program Files\Emacs\.emacs

Note that Windows compatibility isn't tested by the maintainers.  If
you discover problems, please add notes on the Wiki page above, and
submit patches to http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/trac
