Proof General for shell scripts/simple command interpreters.

====================================================================

This instance of PG is handy just for using script management to
cut-and-paste into a buffer running an ordinary shell of some kind.

I'm providing this so that tool demonstrators may use it instead of
tediously doing cut-and-paste of commands from a file.  No history
management, and nothing to do with theorem proving really!

To use this instance of PG, visit a file with the ".pgsh" extension.

You can modify the settings in pgshell.el to suit your application
(e.g. run some program other than the shell).

Feedback welcome.
