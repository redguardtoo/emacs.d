===========================================================================

Isabelle/Isar Proof General has full support for multiple file
scripting, with dependencies between theories communicated between
Isabelle and Proof General.  

There is full support for Unicode Tokens, using the Isabelle print
mode for X Symbol tokens.  Many Isabelle theories have X Symbol syntax
already defined and it's easy to add to your own theories.

The script `interface' and file 'interface-setup.el' are used
internally to start Isabelle Proof General via the 'isabelle' shell
command.  This is the default way to invoke Proof General from the
Isabelle perspective; it enables Isabelle to provide a consistent
process and file-system environment, including the all-important
isar-keywords.el file.
