Twelf Proof General, for Twelf.

========================================


This is a "technology demonstration" of Proof General for Twelf.

It has basic script management support, with some support for
decoration taken from the present Twelf Emacs mode.

There is support for X Symbol, but not using a proper token language,
and it seems fairly broken because Twelf's syntax highlighting
doesn't work properly with font lock.

I have written this in the hope that somebody from the Twelf community
will adopt it, maintain and improve it, and thus turn it into a proper
instantiation of Proof General.
