ACL2 Proof General, for ACL2.

Written by David Aspinall.

Status:	       alpha; unsupported
Maintainer:    volunteer required
ACL2 version:  Tested briefly with acl2.5
ACL2 homepage: http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2

========================================

This is the absolute bare beginnings of a PG instance for ACL2.
At the moment, only basic script management is configured.

I have written this in the hope that somebody from the ACL2 community
will adopt it, maintain and improve it, and thus turn it into a proper
instantiation of Proof General.
