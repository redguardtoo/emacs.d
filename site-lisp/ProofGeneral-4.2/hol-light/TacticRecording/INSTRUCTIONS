To use this:
1. first compile HOL Light and any extra files up to the particular proof you want to record;
     #use "hol.ml";;
     #use ....

2. Then process the 'main.ml' file
     #use "TacticRecording/main.ml";;

3. Then perform the tactic proof you want to record, using g/e's or prove:
     g `...`;;
     e (...);;
     e (...);;
  OR
     prove (`...`, ... THEN ... THENL [...]);;

4. Use the ML export commands to output the proof in the form you want:

     print_executed_proof ();;
         - Tries to reproduce the inputted proof verbatim, with steps
          corresponding one-to-one to original.

     print_flat_proof ();;
         - Prints the proof as a flatten series single-tactic steps, with no
          tacticals.

     print_thenl_proof ();;
         - Prints the proof as a single-step tactic, connected by THEN for
          single goals and THENL for multiple goals.  This structure directly
          reflects the tree structure of the proof as it was executed.

     print_optimal_proof ();;
         - Like 'print_thenl_proof', but prints a more concise proof, not
          necessarily reflecting the original tree structure.  Currently this
          only performs one improvement: seeing where THENL can be replaced
          with THEN.
