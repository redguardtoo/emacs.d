;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Add the following to your .emacs file:
;; (require 'idle-require)
;; (setq idle-require-symbols '(cedet nxml-mode)) ;; <- Specify packages here.
;; (idle-require 'cedet) ;; <- Or like this.
;; (idle-require-mode 1) ;; starts loading
;;
;; As soon as Emacs goes idle for `idle-require-idle-delay' seconds,
;; `idle-require-mode' will start loading the files, symbols or functions in
;; `idle-require-symbols'.  If that is nil, all autoload functions will be
;; loaded, one at a time.
;;
;; Use `idle-require-load-break' to give your CPU a break between each load.
;; Otherwise, you might create 100% CPU load on your system.
;;
;;; Change Log:
;;
;;    The order of calls to `idle-require' is now maintained.
;;    Made `idle-require' parameters compatible to `require'.
;;
;; 2008-02-26 (1.0)
;;    Added convenience function `idle-require'.
;;
;; 2007-05-04 (0.9)
;;    Initial release.
