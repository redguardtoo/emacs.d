;;; Commentary:

;; This package emulates surround.vim by Tim Pope.
;; The functionality is wrapped into a minor mode. To enable
;; it globally, add the following lines to ~/.emacs:
;;
;;     (require 'evil-surround)
;;     (global-evil-surround-mode 1)
;;
;; Alternatively, you can enable evil-surround-mode along a major mode
;; by adding `turn-on-evil-surround-mode' to the mode hook.
;;
;; This package uses Evil as its vi layer. It is available from:
;;
;;     http://gitorious.org/evil
