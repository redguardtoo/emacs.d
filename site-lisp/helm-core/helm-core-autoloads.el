In KEYMAP, define key sequence KEY for function list FUNCTIONS.
Each function run sequentially each time the key KEY is pressed.
If DELAY is specified switch back to initial function of FUNCTIONS list
after DELAY seconds.
The functions in FUNCTIONS list are functions with no args.
e.g
  (defun foo ()
    (message \"Run foo\"))
  (defun bar ()
    (message \"Run bar\"))
  (defun baz ()
    (message \"Run baz\"))

\(helm-define-multi-key global-map \"<f5> q\" '(foo bar baz) 2)

Each time \"<f5> q\" is pressed the next function is executed, if you wait
More than 2 seconds, next hit will run again the first function and so on.

(autoload 'helm-define-key-with-subkeys "helm" "\
Allow defining in MAP a KEY and SUBKEY to COMMAND.

This allow typing KEY to call COMMAND the first time and
type only SUBKEY on subsequent calls.

Arg MAP is the keymap to use, SUBKEY is the initial short keybinding to
call COMMAND.

Arg OTHER-SUBKEYS is an alist specifying other short keybindings
to use once started.
e.g:

\(helm-define-key-with-subkeys global-map
   (kbd \"C-x v n\") ?n 'git-gutter:next-hunk '((?p . git-gutter:previous-hunk)))


In this example, `C-x v n' will run `git-gutter:next-hunk'
subsequent hits on \"n\" will run this command again
and subsequent hits on \"p\" will run `git-gutter:previous-hunk'.

Arg MENU is a string to display in minibuffer
to describe SUBKEY and OTHER-SUBKEYS.
Arg EXIT-FN specify a function to run on exit.

Any other keys pressed run their assigned command defined in MAP
and exit the loop running EXIT-FN if specified.

NOTE: SUBKEY and OTHER-SUBKEYS bindings support
only char syntax actually (e.g ?n)
so don't use strings, vectors or whatever to define them.

Main function to execute helm sources.

Keywords supported:
:sources :input :prompt :resume :preselect
:buffer :keymap :default :history :allow-nest

Extra LOCAL-VARS keywords are supported, see below.

PLIST is a list like (:key1 val1 :key2 val2 ...) or
\(&optional sources input prompt resume
            preselect buffer keymap default history).

Basic keywords are the following:

:sources

A list of sources used for this session.  It also accepts a
symbol, interpreted as a variable of a helm source
i.e (a symbol can be passed instead of a list of sources).
It also accepts an alist representing a helm source, which is
detected by (assq 'name ANY-SOURCES).
NOTE: In this case the source is embedded in the helm command and
have no symbol name, so it is not reachable from outside.
It will be referenced in `helm-sources' as a whole alist.

:input

Temporary value of `helm-pattern', ie. initial input of minibuffer.

:prompt

Prompt other than \"pattern: \".

:resume

If t, Resurrect previously instance of `helm'.  Skip the initialization.
If 'noresume, this instance of `helm' cannot be resumed.

:preselect

Initially selected candidate.  Specified by exact candidate or a regexp.

:buffer

`helm-buffer' instead of *helm*.

:keymap

`helm-map' for current `helm' session.

:default

A default argument that will be inserted in minibuffer with \\<minibuffer-local-map>\\[next-history-element].
When nil or not present `thing-at-point' will be used instead.
If `helm--maybe-use-default-as-input' is non--nil display will be
updated using :default arg as input unless :input is specified,
which in this case will take precedence on :default
This is a string or a list, in this case the car of the list will
be used as initial default input, but you will be able to cycle in this
list with \\<minibuffer-local-map>\\[next-history-element].

:history

By default all minibuffer input is pushed to `minibuffer-history',
if an argument HISTORY is provided, input will be pushed to HISTORY.
History element should be a symbol.

:allow-nest

Allow running this helm command within a running helm session.

Of course, conventional arguments are supported, the two are same.

\(helm :sources sources :input input :prompt prompt :resume resume
       :preselect preselect :buffer buffer :keymap keymap :default default
       :history history)

and

\(helm sources input prompt resume preselect buffer keymap default history)

are the same.

However the use of non keyword args is deprecated and should not be used.

Other keywords are interpreted as local variables of this helm session.
The `helm-' prefix can be omitted.  For example,

\(helm :sources 'helm-source-buffers-list
       :buffer \"*buffers*\" :candidate-number-limit 10)

means starting helm session with `helm-source-buffers'
source in *buffers* buffer and set variable `helm-candidate-number-limit'
to 10 as session local variable.
