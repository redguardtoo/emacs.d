;;; Commentary:

;; This library is intended to aid in the construction of functions
;; for navigating projects.  The `defjump' function using a hopefully
;; convenient specification schema which jumps to new file/methods
;; based upon the file/method context of the current buffer/point.

;; This effort was inspired heavily by find-file-in-project.el by Phil
;; Hagelberg and Doug Alcorn, and toggle.el by Ryan Davis.  The
;; initial goal of jump.el was to subsume both of these tools.

;;; Example: (jumping to the related model in a rails application)

;; (defjump
;;   'rinari-find-model
;;   '(("app/controllers/\\1_controller.rb#\\2"  . "app/models/\\1.rb#\\2")

NAME will then try subsequent jump-from-specs until one succeeds,
at which point any resulting match information, along with the
related jump-to-spec will be used to jump to the intended buffer.
See `jump-to' and `jump-from' for information on spec
construction.

ROOT should specify the root of the project in which all jumps
take place, it can be either a string directory path, or a
function returning

Optional argument DOC specifies the documentation of the
resulting function.

Optional argument MAKE can be used to specify that missing files
should be created.  If MAKE is a function then it will be called
with the file path as it's only argument.  After possibly calling
MAKE `find-file' will be used to open the path.

Optional argument METHOD-COMMAND overrides the function used to
find the current method which defaults to `which-function'."
