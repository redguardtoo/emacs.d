Define NAME as a function with behavior determined by SPECS.
SPECS should be a list of cons cells of the form

   (jump-from-spec . jump-to-spec)

NAME will then try subsequent jump-from-specs until one succeeds,
at which point any resulting match information, along with the
related jump-to-spec will be used to jump to the intended buffer.
See `jump-to' and `jump-from' for information on spec
construction.

ROOT should specify the root of the project in which all jumps
take place, it can be either a string directory path, or a
function returning

Optional argument DOC specifies the documentation of the
resulting function.

Optional argument MAKE can be used to specify that missing files
should be created.  If MAKE is a function then it will be called
with the file path as it's only argument.  After possibly calling
MAKE `find-file' will be used to open the path.

Optional argument METHOD-COMMAND overrides the function used to
find the current method which defaults to `which-function'.
