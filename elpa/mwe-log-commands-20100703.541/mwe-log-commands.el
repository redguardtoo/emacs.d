;;; Commentary:

;; This add-on can be used to demo Emacs to an audience.  When
;; activated, keystrokes get logged into a designated buffer, along
;; with the command bound to them.

;; To enable, use e.g.: 
;;
;; (add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook (function mwe:log-keyboard-commands))
;;
;; To see the log buffer, call M-x mwe:open-command-log-buffer.
