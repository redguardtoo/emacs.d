;;  - If these commands are used, e.g., in `bbdb-create-hook' or
;;    `bbdb-change-hook', they will be called with one arg, a single record.
;; So depending on context the value of RECORDS will be a single record
;; or a list of records, and we want to handle both cases.
;; So we pass RECORDS to `bbdb-record-list' to handle both cases.

;; - `bbdb-append-display' and `bbdb-search-invert' are fake prefix
;;   commands. They need not precede the main commands.
;;   Also, `bbdb-append-display' can act on multiple commands.
;; FIXME: Make this more uniform and robust.
