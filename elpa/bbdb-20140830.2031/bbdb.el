;; If the user calls `add-hook' in the init file (usually before loading

;; the respective hook variable.  Yet this collides with a non-nil
;; default value of a hook variable because a non-nil INITVALUE for `defvar'
;; or `defcustom' has no effect if a variable is already bound.
;; Therefore, the following code calls `add-hook' unconditionally.
;; Yet this is not a perfect solution either for two reasons.
;; First, `defcustom' gets confused if the default is set outside `defcustom'.
;; So we use `defvar', though these are really user variables.
;; Second, if the user wants to remove the default functions from the
;; respective hooks, the current solution requires that he or she calls
;; `remove-hook' *after* loading bbdb.el.  However, it is more likely that
;; users call `add-hook' on these variables in their init files than calling
;; `remove-hook'.  In that sense, the following should work for most people.

- toggle: controls if this layout is included when toggeling the layout
- order: defines a user specific order for the fields, where t is a place
  holder for all remaining fields
- omit: is a list of xfields which should not be displayed
  or t to exclude all xfields except those listed in the order option
- name-end: sets the column where the name should end in one-line layout.
- indentation: sets the level of indentation for multi-line display.
- primary: controls whether only the primary mail is shown or all are shown.
- display-p: a function controlling whether the record is to be displayed.

function `bbdb-display-record-layout-FOO'.  If you do not write your own
layout function, the multi-line layout will be used."

the last rule that becomes a fall-back (default).

EDIT may be a function that is called with one argument, the address.
See `bbdb-edit-address-default' for an example.

EDIT may also be an editting format string.  It is a string containing
the five letters s, c, p, S, and C that specify the order for editing
the five elements of an address:

s  streets
c  city
p  postcode
S  state
C  country

The first FORMAT of each rule is used for multi-line layout, the second FORMAT
is used for one-line layout.

FORMAT may be a function that is called with one argument, the address.
See `bbdb-format-address-default' for an example.

FORMAT may also be a format string.  It consists of formatting elements
separated by a delimiter defined via the first (and last) character of FORMAT.
Each formatting element may contain one of the following format specifiers:

%s  streets (used repeatedly for each street part)
%c  city
%p  postcode
%S  state
%C  country

A formatting element will be applied only if the corresponding part
of the address is a non-empty string.

  "List of rules for adding notes to records of mail addresses of messages.
This automatically annotates the BBDB record of the sender or recipient
of a message based on the value of a header such as the Subject header.
This requires that `bbdb-notice-mail-hook' contains `bbdb-auto-notes'
and that the record already exists or `bbdb-update-records-p' returns such that
the record will be created.  Messages matching `bbdb-auto-notes-ignore-messages'
are ignored.

The elements of this list are

   (MUA FROM-TO HEADER ANNOTATE ...)
   (FROM-TO HEADER ANNOTATE ...)
   (HEADER ANNOTATE ...)

MUA is the active MUA or a list of MUAs (see `bbdb-mua').
If MUA is missing or t, use this rule for all MUAs.

FROM-TO is a list of headers and/or header classes as in `bbdb-message-headers'.
The record corresponding to a mail address of a message is considered for
annotation if this mail address was found in a header matching FROM-TO.
If FROM-TO is missing or t, records for each mail address are considered
irrespective of where the mail address was found in a message.

HEADER is a message header that is considered for generating the annotation.

ANNOTATE may take the following values:

  (REGEXP . STRING)       [this is equivalent to (REGEXP notes STRING)]
  (REGEXP FIELD STRING)
  (REGEXP FIELD STRING REPLACE)

REGEXP must match the value of HEADER for generating an annotation.
However, if the value of HEADER also matches an element of
`bbdb-auto-notes-ignore-headers' no annotation is generated.

The annotation will be added to FIELD of the respective record.
FIELD defaults to `bbdb-default-xfield'.

STRING defines a replacement for the match of REGEXP in the value of HEADER.
It may contain \\& or \\N specials used by `replace-match'.
The resulting string becomes the annotation.
If STRING is an integer N, the Nth matching subexpression is used.
If STRING is a function, it will be called with one arg, the value of HEADER.
The return value (which must be a string) is then used.

If REPLACE is t, the resulting string replaces the old contents of FIELD.
If it is nil, the string is appended to the contents of FIELD (unless the
annotation is already part of the content of field).

For example,

   ((\"To\" (\"-vm@\" . \"VM mailing list\"))
    (\"Subject\" (\"sprocket\" . \"mail about sprockets\")
               (\"you bonehead\" . \"called me a bonehead\")))

will cause the text \"VM mailing list\" to be added to the notes field
of the records corresponding to anyone you get mail from via one of the VM
mailing lists.

If multiple clauses match the message, all of the corresponding strings
will be added.

See also variables `bbdb-auto-notes-ignore-messages' and
`bbdb-auto-notes-ignore-headers'.

For speed-up, the function `bbdb-auto-notes' actually use expanded rules
stored in the internal variable `bbdb-auto-notes-rules-expanded'.
If you change the value of `bbdb-auto-notes-rules' outside of customize,
set `bbdb-auto-notes-rules-expanded' to nil, so that the expanded rules
will be re-evaluated."
