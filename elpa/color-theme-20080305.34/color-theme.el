Use \\[color-theme-install-at-point] to install a color theme on all frames.
Use \\[color-theme-install-at-point-for-current-frame] to install a color theme for the current frame only.

The changes are applied on top of your current setup.  This is a
feature.

Some of the themes should be considered extensions to the standard color
theme: they modify only a limited number of faces and variables.  To
verify the final look of a color theme, install the standard color
theme, then install the other color theme.  This is a feature. It allows
you to mix several color themes.

Use \\[color-theme-describe] to read more about the color theme function at point.
If you want to install the color theme permanently, put the call to the
color theme function into your ~/.emacs:

    \(require 'color-theme)
    \(color-theme-gnome2)

If you worry about the size of color-theme.el: You are right.  Use
\\[color-theme-print] to print the current color theme and save the resulting buffer
as ~/.emacs-color-theme.  Now you can install only this specific color
theme in your .emacs:

    \(load-file \"~/.emacs-color-theme\")
    \(my-color-theme)

The Emacs menu is not affected by color themes within Emacs.  Depending
on the toolkit you used to compile Emacs, you might have to set specific
X ressources.  See the info manual for more information.  Here is an
example ~/.Xdefaults fragment:

    emacs*Background: DarkSlateGray
    emacs*Foreground: wheat
