;;; Commentary:
;;
;;    Extensions to Dired.
;;
;;  This file extends functionalities provided by standard GNU Emacs
;;  files `dired.el', `dired-aux.el', and `dired-x.el'.
;;
;;  Key bindings changed.  Menus redefined.  `diredp-mouse-3-menu'
;;  popup menu added.  New commands.  Some commands enhanced.
;;
;;  All of the new functions, variables, and faces defined here have
;;  the prefix `diredp-' (for Dired Plus) in their names.
;;
;;
;;  Wraparound Navigation
;;  ---------------------
;;
;;  In vanilla Dired, `dired-next-marked-file' (`M-}' or `* C-n') and
;;  `dired-previous-marked-file' (`M-{' or `* C-p') wrap around when
;;  you get to the end or the beginning of the Dired buffer.  Handy.
;;
;;  But the other navigation commands do not wrap around.  In `Dired+'
;;  they do, provided option `diredp-wrap-around-flag' is non-nil,
;;  which it is by default.  This means the following commands:
;;
;;    `diredp-next-line'     - `n', `C-n', `down', `SPC'
;;    `diredp-previous-line' - `p', `C-p', `up'
;;    `diredp-next-dirline'  - `>'
;;    `diredp-prev-dirline'  - `<'
;;    `diredp-next-subdir'   - `C-M-n'
;;    `diredp-prev-subdir'   - `C-M-p'
;;
;;
;;  Hide/Show Details
;;  -----------------
;;
;;  Starting with Emacs 24.4, listing details are hidden by default.
;;  Use `(' anytime to toggle this hiding.  You can use option
;;  `diredp-hide-details-initially-flag' to change the default/initial
;;  state.  See also option `diredp-hide-details-propagate-flag'.
;;
;;  NOTE: If you do not want to hide details initially then you must
;;        either (1) change `diredp-hide-details-initially-flag' using
;;        Customize (recommended) or (2) set it to `nil' (e.g., using
;;        `setq') *BEFORE* loading `dired+.el'.
;;
;;  If you have an Emacs version older than 24.4, you can use library
;;  `dired-details+.el' (plus `dired-details.el') to get similar
;;  behavior.
;;
;;
;;  Fontification Level
;;  -------------------
;;
;;  If you want a maximum or minimum fontification for Dired mode,
;;  then customize option `font-lock-maximum-decoration'.  If you want
;;  a different fontification level for Dired than for other modes,
;;  you can do this too by customizing
;;  `font-lock-maximize-decoration'.
;;
;;
;;  Act on All Files
;;  ----------------
;;
;;  Most of the commands (such as `C' and `M-g') that operate on the
;;  marked files have the added feature here that multiple `C-u' use
;;  not the files that are marked or the next or previous N files, but
;;  *all* of the files in the Dired buffer.  Just what "all" files
;;  means changes with the number of `C-u', as follows:
;;
;;    `C-u C-u'         - Use all files present, but no directories.
;;    `C-u C-u C-u'     - Use all files and dirs except `.' and `..'.
;;    `C-u C-u C-u C-u' - use all files and dirs, `.' and `..'.
;;
;;    (More than four `C-u' act the same as two.)
;;
;;  This feature can be particularly useful when you have a Dired
;;  buffer with files chosen from multiple directories.
;;
;;  Note that this behavior is described only in the doc string of
;;  function `dired-get-marked-files'.  It is *not* described in the
;;  doc strings of the various commands, because that would require
;;  redefining each command separately here.  Instead, we redefine
;;  only macro `dired-map-over-marks' and function
;;  `dired-get-filename' in order to achieve this effect.
;;
;;
;;  Act on Marked (or All) Files Here and Below
;;  -------------------------------------------
;;
;;  The prefix argument behavior just described does not apply to the
;;  `diredp-*-recursive' commands.  These commands act on the marked
;;  files in the current Dired buffer or on all files in the directory
;;  if none are marked.
;;
;;  But these commands also handle marked subdirectories recursively,
;;  in the same way.  That is, they act also on the marked files in
;;  any marked subdirectories, found recursively.  If there is no
;;  Dired buffer for a given marked subdirectory then all of its files
;;  and subdirs are acted on.
;;
;;  With a prefix argument, all marks are ignored.  The commands act
;;  on all files in the current Dired buffer and all of its
;;  subdirectories, recursively.
;;
;;  All of the `diredp-*-recursive' commands are on prefix key `M-+',
;;  and they are available on submenu `Marked Here and Below' of the
;;  `Multiple' menu-bar menu.
;;
;;  If you use library `Icicles' then you have these additional
;;  commands/keys that act recursively on marked files.  They are in
;;  the `Icicles' submenu of menu `Multiple' > `Marked Here and
;;  Below'.
;;
;;  * `M-+ M-s M-s' or `M-s M-s m' - Use Icicles search (and its
;;                  on-demand replace) on the marked files.
;;
;;  * Save the names of the marked files:
;;
;;    `M-+ C-M->' - Save as a completion set, for use during
;;                  completion (e.g. with `C-x C-f').
;;
;;    `M-+ C->'   - Add marked names to the names in the current saved
;;                  completion set.
;;
;;    `M-+ C-}'   - Save persistently to an Icicles cache file, for
;;                  use during completion in another session.
;;
;;    `icicle-dired-save-marked-to-fileset-recursive' - Like `M-+
;;                  C-}', but save persistently to an Emacs fileset.
;;
;;    `M-+ C-M-}' - Save to a Lisp variable.
;;
;;
;;  In the other direction, if you have a saved set of file names then
;;  you can use `C-M-<' (`icicle-dired-chosen-files-other-window') in
;;  Dired to open a Dired buffer for just those files.  So you can
;;  mark some files and subdirs in a hierarchy of Dired buffers, use
;;  `M-+ C-}' to save their names persistently, then later use `C-{'
;;  to retrieve them, and `C-M-<' (in Dired) to open Dired on them.
;;
;;
;;  Image Files
;;  -----------
;;
;;  `Dired+' provides several enhancements regarding image files.
;;  Most of these require standard library `image-dired.el'.  One of
;;  them, command `diredp-do-display-images', which displays all of
;;  the marked image files, requires library `image-file.el'.
;;
;;  `Dired+' loads these libraries automatically, if available, which
;;  means an Emacs version that supports image display (Emacs 22 or
;;  later).  (You must of course have installed whatever else your
;;  Emacs version needs to display images.)
;;
;;  Besides command `diredp-do-display-images', see the commands whose
;;  names have prefix `diredp-image-'.  And see options
;;  `diredp-image-preview-in-tooltip' and
;;  `diredp-auto-focus-frame-for-thumbnail-tooltip-flag'.
;;    
;;
;;  Inserted Subdirs, Multiple Dired Buffers, Files from Anywhere,...
;;  -----------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;;  These three standard Dired features are worth pointing out.  The
;;  third in particular is little known because (a) it is limited in
;;  vanilla Dired and (b) you cannot use it interactively.
;;
;;   * You can pass a glob pattern with wildcards to `dired'
;;     interactively, as the file name.
;;
;;   * You can insert multiple subdirectory listings into a single
;;     Dired buffer using `i' on each subdir line.  Use `C-u i' to
;;     specify `ls' switches.  Specifying switch `R' inserts the
;;     inserted subdirectory's subdirs also, recursively.  You can
;;     also use `i' to bounce between a subdirectory line and its
;;     inserted-listing header line.  You can delete a subdir listing
;;     using `C-u k' on its header line.  You can hide/show an
;;     inserted subdir using `$'.  You can use `C-_' to undo any of
;;     these operations.
;;
;;   * You can open a Dired buffer for an arbitrary set of files from
;;     different directories.  You do this by invoking `dired'
;;     non-interactively, passing it a cons of a Dired buffer name and
;;     the file names.  Relative file names are interpreted relative
;;     to the value of `default-directory'.  Use absolute file names
;;     when appropriate.
;;
;;  `Dired+' makes these features more useful.
;;
;;  `$' is improved: It is a simple toggle - it does not move the
;;  cursor forward.  `M-$' advances the cursor, in addition to
;;  toggling like `$'.  `C-u $' does hide/show all (what `M-$' does in
;;  vanilla Dired).
;;
;;  `i' is improved in these ways:
;;
;;   * Once a subdir has been inserted, `i' bounces between the subdir
;;     listing and the subdir line in the parent listing.  If the
;;     parent dir is hidden, then `i' from a subdir opens the parent
;;     listing so it can move to the subdir line there (Emacs 24+).
;;
;;   * Vanilla Dired lets you create a Dired listing with files and
;;     directories from arbitrary locations, but you cannot insert
;;     (`i') such a directory if it is not in the same directory tree
;;     as the `default-directory' used to create the Dired buffer.
;;     `Dired+' removes this limitation; you can insert any non-root
;;     directories (that is, not `/', `c:/', etc.).
;;
;;  `Dired+' lets you create Dired buffers that contain arbitrary
;;  files and directories interactively, not just using Lisp.  Just
;;  use a non-positive prefix arg (e.g., `C--') when invoking `dired'.
;;
;;  You are then prompted for the Dired buffer name (anything you
;;  like, not necessarily a directory name) and the individual files
;;  and directories that you want listed.
;;
;;  A non-negative prefix arg still prompts you for the `ls' switches
;;  to use.  (So `C-0' does both: prompts for `ls' switches and for
;;  the Dired buffer name and the files to list.)
;;
;;  `Dired+' adds commands for combining and augmenting Dired
;;  listings:
;;
;;   * `diredp-add-to-dired-buffer', bound globally to `C-x E' ("E"
;;     for extra files), lets you add arbitrary file and directory
;;     names to an existing Dired buffer.
;;
;;   * `diredp-dired-union', bound globally to `C-x D', lets you take
;;     the union of multiple Dired listings, or convert an ordinary
;;     Dired listing to an explicit list of absolute file names.  With
;;     a non-positive prefix arg, you can add extra file and directory
;;     names, just as for `diredp-add-to-dired-buffer'.
;;
;;  Some other libraries, such as `Bookmark+' and `Icicles', make it
;;  easy to create or re-create Dired buffers that list specific files
;;  and have a particular set of markings.  `Bookmark+' records Dired
;;  buffers persistently, remembering `ls' switches, markings, subdir
;;  insertions, and hidden subdirs.  If you use `Icicles' then `dired'
;;  is a multi-command: you can open multiple Dired buffers with one
;;  `dired' invocation.
;;
;;  Dired can help you manage projects.  You might have multiple Dired
;;  buffers with quite specific contents.  You might have some
;;  subdirectories inserted in the same Dired buffer, and you might
;;  have separate Dired buffers for some subdirectories.  Sometimes it
;;  is useful to have both for the same subdirectory.  And sometimes
;;  it is useful to move from one presentation to the other.
;;
;;  This is one motivation for the `Dired+' `diredp-*-recursive'
;;  commands, which act on the marked files in marked subdirectories,
;;  recursively.  In one sense, these commands are an alternative to
;;  using a single Dired buffer with inserted subdirectories.  They
;;  let you use the same operations on the files in a set of Dired
;;  directories, without inserting those directories into an ancestor
;;  Dired buffer.
;;
;;  You can use command `diredp-dired-inserted-subdirs' to open a
;;  separate Dired buffer for each of the subdirs that is inserted in
;;  the current Dired buffer.  Markings and Dired switches are
;;  preserved.
;;
;;  In the opposite direction, if you use `Icicles' then you can use
;;  multi-command `icicle-dired-insert-as-subdir', which lets you
;;  insert any number of directories you choose interactively into a
;;  Dired ancestor directory listing.  If a directory you choose to
;;  insert already has its own Dired buffer, then its markings and
;;  switches are preserved for the new, subdirectory listing in the
;;  ancestor Dired buffer.

the short form of the filename) for a failure and probably logs a
detailed error explanation using function `dired-log'.

ARG is as in `dired-map-over-marks'.

OP-SYMBOL is a symbol describing the operation performed (e.g.
`compress').  It is used with `dired-mark-pop-up' to prompt the user
\(e.g. with `Compress * [2 files]? ') and to display errors (e.g.
`Failed to compress 1 of 2 files - type W to see why (\"foo\")')

(defadvice dired (before diredp-doc-cons-arg activate)
  "Interactively, a prefix argument changes the behavior as follows:

* If >= 0, you are first prompted for the `ls' switches to use.

* If <= 0, you are prompted first for the name of the Dired  buffer.
  Then you are prompted repeatedly for the names of the directories
  or files to list in the buffer.  You can use file-name wildcards
  (i.e., `*' for globbing), to include the matching files and
  directories.  Use `C-g' to end.

  In other words, instead of listing a single directory, the Dired
  buffer can list any number of directories and file names, which can
  even belong to different directory trees.

The rest of this description applies only if you use Icicles.

In Icicle mode this is a multi-command: You can cycle among file-name
completion candidates and act individually on those that name
directories.  The action is to open Dired for the directory.  While
cycling, these keys are active:

\\<minibuffer-local-completion-map>\
`C-mouse-2', `C-return' - Act on current completion candidate only
`C-down', `C-wheel-down' - Move to next completion candidate and act
`C-up', `C-wheel-up' - Move to previous completion candidate and act
`C-next'  - Move to next apropos-completion candidate and act
`C-prior' - Move to previous apropos-completion candidate and act
`C-end'   - Move to next prefix-completion candidate and act
`C-home'  - Move to previous prefix-completion candidate and act
`\\[icicle-all-candidates-action]'     - Act on *all* candidates, successively (careful!)
`\\[icicle-all-candidates-list-alt-action]'     - Open Dired on all candidates

When candidate action and cycling are combined (e.g. `C-next'), user
option `icicle-act-before-cycle-flag' determines which occurs first.

With prefix `C-M-' instead of `C-', the same keys (`C-M-mouse-2',
`C-M-RET', `C-M-down', and so on) provide help about candidates.

Use `mouse-2', `RET', or `S-RET' to finally choose a candidate, or
`C-g' to quit.

These keys are also bound in the minibuffer during completion (`*'
means the key requires library `Bookmark+'):

   S-delete    - Delete candidate file or (empty) dir
   C-c +       - Create a new directory
   C-backspace - Go up one directory level
 * C-x C-t *   - Narrow to files with all of the tags you specify
 * C-x C-t +   - Narrow to files with some of the tags you specify
 * C-x C-t % * - Narrow to files with all tags matching a regexp
 * C-x C-t % + - Narrow to files with some tags  matching a regexp
 * C-x a +     - Add tags to the current-candidate file
 * C-x a -     - Remove tags from the current-candidate file
 * C-x m       - Access file bookmarks (not just autofiles)")

  "Create a Dired buffer that is the union of some existing Dired buffers.
With a non-negative prefix arg, you are prompted for `ls' switches.
With a non-positive prefix arg, you are prompted for file and dir
names to add to the listing - see below.

You are prompted for the name of the Dired union buffer.  Completion
against names of existing Dired buffers is available, but you can
enter any other name to create a new Dired buffer of that name.

If the union buffer name you choose names an existing Dired buffer,
then what happens depends on whether that buffer is an ordinary Dired
directory listing or a list of arbitrary file names.  That is, it
depends on whether `dired-directory' is a directory name or a cons of
a Dired buffer name plus file names.

* If the buffer is an ordinary Dired listing, then it is converted to
  an explicit list of absolute file names, just as if these had been
  chosen individually.  The existing buffer and window are replaced by
  new ones that show the explicit listing.  (This replacement is
  necessary because the list of files contained in an ordinary Dired
  listing cannot be modified.)

* If the buffer lists arbitrary file names explicitly, then it is
  updated to include also the files from any Dired buffers and any
  additional files that you specify.

If the union buffer name you choose does not name an existing Dired
buffer, then its `default-directory' is the same as the
`default-directory' before invoking the command.

If you use a non-positive prefix arg, then you can next choose
additional file and directory names to add to the listing.  Use `C-g'
when done choosing them.  Any directory names you choose this way are
included as single entries in the listing - the directory contents are
not included (these directories are not unioned).

You are then prompted for the Dired buffers to union.  Use `C-g' when
done choosing them.  These Dired listings to union are included in the
order that you chose them, and each entry is listed only once in the
new Dired buffer.

The new Dired listing respects the markings, subdirectory insertions,
and hidden subdirectories of the selected Dired listings.  However, in
case of conflict between marked or unmarked status for the same entry,
the entry is marked.  Similarly, in case of conflict over an included
subdirectory between it being hidden or shown, it is hidden, but its
contained files are also listed.

From Lisp:
 DIRED-NAME is the name of the resulting Dired union buffer.
 DIRBUFS is a list of the names of Dired buffers to union.
 SWITCHES is a string of `ls' switches.
 EXTRA is a list of files & directories to be included in the listing."

This bounces you back and forth between a subdirectory line and its

subdirectory listing acts the same as using it on the subdirectory
header line.

* If on a subdirectory line, then go to the subdirectory's listing,

  a subdirectory listing, then go to the line for the subdirectory in

Subdirectories are listed in the same position as for `ls -lR' output.

With a prefix arg, you can edit the `ls' switches used for this
listing.  Add `R' to the switches to expand the directory tree under a
subdirectory.

Dired remembers the switches you specify with a prefix arg, so
reverting the buffer does not reset them.  However, you might
sometimes need to reset some subdirectory switches after a
`dired-undo'.  You can reset all subdirectory switches to the
default value using \\<dired-mode-map>\\[dired-reset-subdir-switches].  See \

;;;
;;; * `dired-simultaneous-find-file' runs through FILE-LIST decrementing the
;;;   list each time.
;;;
;;; * If OPTION and `pop-up-frames' are both nil, then calculate the
;;; `size' of the window for each file by dividing the `window-height'
;;; by length of FILE-LIST.  Thus, `size' is cognizant of the
;;; window-configuration.
;;;
;;; * If `size' is too small abort, otherwise run `find-file' on each element
;;;   of FILE-LIST giving each a window of height `size'.

    `nlink'  [integer] number of links to file
    `size'   [integer] file size in bytes

    `gid'    [string]  group (If the gid is not displayed by `ls',

    `time'   [string]  the time that `ls' displays, e.g. \"Feb 12 14:17\"
    `name'   [string]  the name of the file
    `sym'    [string]  if file is a symbolic link, the linked-to name,
