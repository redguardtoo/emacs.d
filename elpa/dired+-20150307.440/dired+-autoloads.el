(autoload 'diredp-dired-union "dired+" "\
Create a Dired buffer that is the union of some existing Dired buffers.
With a non-negative prefix arg, you are prompted for `ls' switches.
With a non-positive prefix arg, you are prompted for file and dir
names to add to the listing - see below.

You are prompted for the name of the Dired union buffer.  Completion
against names of existing Dired buffers is available, but you can
enter any other name to create a new Dired buffer of that name.

If the union buffer name you choose names an existing Dired buffer,
then what happens depends on whether that buffer is an ordinary Dired
directory listing or a list of arbitrary file names.  That is, it
depends on whether `dired-directory' is a directory name or a cons of
a Dired buffer name plus file names.

* If the buffer is an ordinary Dired listing, then it is converted to
  an explicit list of absolute file names, just as if these had been
  chosen individually.  The existing buffer and window are replaced by
  new ones that show the explicit listing.  (This replacement is
  necessary because the list of files contained in an ordinary Dired
  listing cannot be modified.)

* If the buffer lists arbitrary file names explicitly, then it is
  updated to include also the files from any Dired buffers and any
  additional files that you specify.

If the union buffer name you choose does not name an existing Dired
buffer, then its `default-directory' is the same as the
`default-directory' before invoking the command.

If you use a non-positive prefix arg, then you can next choose
additional file and directory names to add to the listing.  Use `C-g'
when done choosing them.  Any directory names you choose this way are
included as single entries in the listing - the directory contents are
not included (these directories are not unioned).

You are then prompted for the Dired buffers to union.  Use `C-g' when
done choosing them.  These Dired listings to union are included in the
order that you chose them, and each entry is listed only once in the
new Dired buffer.

The new Dired listing respects the markings, subdirectory insertions,
and hidden subdirectories of the selected Dired listings.  However, in
case of conflict between marked or unmarked status for the same entry,
the entry is marked.  Similarly, in case of conflict over an included
subdirectory between it being hidden or shown, it is hidden, but its
contained files are also listed.

From Lisp:
 DIRED-NAME is the name of the resulting Dired union buffer.
 DIRBUFS is a list of the names of Dired buffers to union.
 SWITCHES is a string of `ls' switches.
 EXTRA is a list of files & directories to be included in the listing.

If you want to include a directory listing (ordinary or of arbitrary

command `diredp-dired-union' instead.

  creating it if not yet present.

* If on a subdirectory listing header line or a non-directory file in
  a subdirectory listing, then go to the line for the subdirectory in
  the parent directory listing.

  nothing.

Subdirectories are listed in the same position as for `ls -lR' output.

With a prefix arg, you can edit the `ls' switches used for this
listing.  Add `R' to the switches to expand the directory tree under a
subdirectory.

Dired remembers the switches you specify with a prefix arg, so
reverting the buffer does not reset them.  However, you might
sometimes need to reset some subdirectory switches after a
`dired-undo'.  You can reset all subdirectory switches to the
default value using \\<dired-mode-map>\\[dired-reset-subdir-switches].  See Info node
`(emacs)Subdir switches' for more details.

Find marked files, displaying all of them simultaneously.
With a prefix ARG >= 0, just find the files but do not show them.

If no prefix ARG, and variable `pop-up-frames' is non-nil, or

Otherwise (no prefix ARG and nil `pop-up-frames'), the current window
is split across all marked files, as evenly as possible.  Remaining
lines go to the bottom-most window.  The number of files that can be
displayed this way is restricted by the height of the current window
and `window-min-height'.

A prefix argument also behaves according to the ARG argument of
`dired-get-marked-files'.  In particular, `C-u C-u' operates on all
files in the Dired buffer.
