   Geiser is a collection of Emacs major and minor modes that conspire
with one or more Scheme interpreters to keep the Lisp Machine Spirit
alive.  It draws inspiration (and a bit more) from environments such as
Common Lisp's Slime, Factor's FUEL, Squeak or Emacs itself, and does its
best to make Scheme hacking inside Emacs (even more) fun.

   Or, to be precise, what i (http://hacks-galore.org/jao) consider fun.
Geiser is thus my humble contribution to the dynamic school of
expression, and a reaction against what i perceive as a derailment, in
modern times, of standard Scheme towards the static camp.  Because i
prefer growing and healing to poking at corpses, the continuously
running Scheme interpreter takes the center of the stage in Geiser.  A
bundle of Elisp shims orchestrates the dialog between the Scheme
interpreter, Emacs and, ultimately, the schemer, giving her access to
live metadata.  Here's how.

Geiser is an Emacs environment to hack and have fun in Scheme.  If
that's enough for you, see *note Installation:: to get it running and
*note The REPL:: for the fun part.

File: geiser.info,  Node: Modus operandi,  Next: Showing off,  Prev: Introduction,  Up: Introduction

1.1 Modus operandi
==================

As already mentioned, Geiser relies on a running Scheme process to
obtain the information it makes accessible to the programmer.  There's
little effort, on the Elisp side, to understand, say, the module system
used by the Scheme implementation at hand; instead, a generic interface
between the two worlds is defined, and each supported Scheme includes a
library implementing that API, together with some wee shims in Elisp
allowing the reuse of the Emacs-side framework, which constitutes the
bulk of the code.

   While being as generic as possible, the Scheme-Elisp interface makes
some assumptions about the capabilities and interaction mode of the
corresponding REPL. In particular, Geiser expects the latter to support
namespaces in the form of a module system, and to provide a well-defined
way to establish the REPL's current namespace (or module), as well as
the current file's module (or namespace).  Thus, all evaluations
performed by Geiser either in the REPL or in a source code buffer happen
in the context of the current namespace.  Every time you switch to a
different file, you're switching namespaces automatically; at the REPL,
you must request the switch explicitly (usually just using means
provided by the Scheme implementation itself).

   If your favourite Scheme supports the above modus operandi, it has
all that's needed for a bare-bones Geiser mode.  But Geiser can, and
will, use any metadata available: procedure arities and argument lists
to display interactive help, documentation strings, location information
to jump to definitions, export lists to provide completion, and so on
and so forth.  Although this is not an all-or-none proposition (Geiser
can operate with just part of that functionality available), i initially
concentrated in supporting those Schemes with the richest (to my
knowledge) introspection capabilities, namely, Guile and Racket.  Later
on, Dan Leslie added support for Chicken, and there's active work to add
support for scsh.


File: geiser.info,  Node: Showing off,  Prev: Modus operandi,  Up: Introduction

1.2 Showing off
===============

When working with a fully conniving Scheme, Geiser can offer the
following functionality:

   * Form evaluation in the context of the current file's module.
   * Macro expansion.
   * File/module loading and/or compilation.
   * Namespace-aware identifier completion (including local bindings,
     names visible in the current module, and module names).
   * Autodoc: the echo area shows information about the signature of the
     procedure/macro around point automatically.
   * Jump to definition of identifier at point.
   * Access to documentation (including docstrings when the
     implementation provides it).
   * Listings of identifiers exported by a given module.
   * Listings of callers/callees of procedures.
   * Rudimentary support for debugging (when the REPL provides a
     debugger) and error navigation.
   * Support for multiple, simultaneous REPLs.
   * Support for image display in those Schemes that treat them as first
     class values.

   In the following pages, i'll try to explain what these features
actually are (i'm just swanking here), and how to use them for your
profit.  But, before that, let's see how to install Geiser.

* Friends::


File: geiser.info,  Node: Must needs,  Next: The easy and quick way,  Prev: Installation,  Up: Installation

2.1 Must needs
==============

If Geiser came with any guarantees, you'd break all of them by not using
GNU Emacs 23.2 (or better: i regularly use it with a recent Emacs
snapshot) and at least one of the supported Schemes, namely:

   * Racket (http://www.racket-lang.org) 6.0 or better
   * Guile (http://www.gnu.org/software/guile) 2.0.9 or better
   * Chicken (http://call-cc.org) 4.8.0 or better

   Since Geiser supports multiple REPLs, having both of them will just
add to the fun.

   You'll also need Geiser itself.  The quickest installation is via its
ELPA package, as described in the next section.  If you prefer to use
the source code directly, it's not that difficult either: just keep on
reading.


File: geiser.info,  Node: The easy and quick way,  Next: From the source's mouth,  Prev: Must needs,  Up: Installation

2.2 The easy and quick way
==========================

Did i mention that the easiest way of installing Geiser is using its
ELPA (http://emacswiki.org/emacs/ELPA) package?  If you're using Emacs
24, ELPA (http://emacswiki.org/emacs/ELPA) is already there; for earlier
versions, the page i just linked to twice will tell you where to find
the goodies.

   ELPA packages live in repositories accessible via HTTP. You can find
Geiser's package in either MELPA stable
(http://melpa-stable.org/#/geiser) or, if you like living on the
bleeding edge, MELPA (http://melpa.org/#/geiser) (directly from the git
repo).  To tell Emacs that an ELPA repo exists, you add it to
'package-archives':

     (require 'package)
     ;;; either the stable version:

     (add-to-list 'package-archives
       ;; choose either the stable or the latest git version:
       ;; '("melpa-stable" . "http://melpa-stable.org/packages/")
       '("melpa-unstable" . "http://melpa.org/packages/"))

     (package-initialize)

   And then installing Geiser is as easy as:

     M-x package-install RET geiser RET

   Alternatively, you can manually download the package file
(http://download-mirror.savannah.gnu.org/releases/geiser/packages/geiser-0.8.1.tar),
and install from your local disk with 'M-x package-install-file'.

   If you plan to use Chicken, you'll need also to fire a terminal and
configure a couple of Chicken eggs:
     $ chicken-install -s apropos chicken-doc
     $ cd `csi -p '(chicken-home)'`
     $ curl http://3e8.org/pub/chicken-doc/chicken-doc-repo.tgz | sudo tar zx

   With that, you are pretty much all set up.  See *note The REPL:: to
start using Geiser.

2.3 Installing from source
==========================

Downloading Geiser
..................

The latest release tarball can be found here
(http://download-mirror.savannah.gnu.org/releases/geiser/0.8.1/).  Just
download geiser-0.8.1.tar.gz
(http://download-mirror.savannah.gnu.org/releases/geiser/0.8.1/geiser-0.8.1.tar.gz)
and untar it in a directory of your choice.

   If you feel like living on the bleeding edge, just grab Geiser from
its Git repository over at Savannah
(http://git.savannah.nongnu.org/cgit/geiser.git/), either with the
following incantation:

     git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/geiser.git

or, if you happen to live behind a firewall, with the alternative:

     git clone http://git.sv.gnu.org/r/geiser.git

You can also follow Geiser's development in one
(https://github.com/jaor/geiser) or (http://repo.or.cz/w/geiser.git)
three (http://gitorious.org/geiser) mirrors that are kept synchronized
with the one at Savannah.

   Either way, you'll now be in possession of a copy of Geiser's libre
code.  I'll follow you into its directory and the next section.

Setting it up
.............

Geiser is ready to be used out of the box without much more ado.  For
the sake of concreteness, let's assume you put its source in the
directory '~/lisp/geiser'.  All you need to do is to add the following
line to your Emacs initialisation file (be it '~/.emacs' or any of its
moral equivalents):

     (load-file "~/lisp/geiser/elisp/geiser.el")

or simply evaluate that form inside Emacs (you wouldn't kill a friend
just to start using Geiser, would you?).  That's it: you're ready to go
(*note The REPL::).

   What?  You still here?  I promise the above is all that's needed to
start using Geiser.  But, in case you are missing your configure/make
all install routine, by all means, you can go through those motions to
byte compile and install Geiser too.  That is, you enter the source
directory and (since we grabbed the development tree) run the customary
autogen script:

     $ cd ~/lisp/geiser
     $ ./autogen.sh

I recommend that you compile Geiser in a separate directory:

     $ mkdir build && cd build
     $ ../configure
     <some drivel here>
     $ make all
     <more of the above>

   Now you have two options: loading the byte-compiled Geiser from the
'elisp' subdirectory, or installing it system-wide.  To load the
byte-code from here, add this line to your initialisation file:

     (load "~/lisp/geiser/build/elisp/geiser-load")

and eval that form and you're done (you could also restart Emacs, but
killing your friends is widely considered bad form).  Yes, that's 'load'
and 'geiser-load' instead of 'load-file' and 'geiser.el'.

   If you prefer a system-wide installation, just type:

     $ sudo make install

   With the above spell, Geiser will be compiled and installed in a safe
place inside Emacs load path.  To load it into Emacs you'll need,
instead of the 'load-file' form above, the following line in your
initialisation file:

     (require 'geiser-install)

Please note that we're requiring 'geiser-install', and not 'geiser', and
that there's no 'load-file' to be seen this time.  There are some ways
of fine-tuning this process, mainly by providing additional arguments in
the call to configure: you'll find those gory details in the file called
'INSTALL', right at the root of the source tree.  The installation will
also take care of placing this manual, in Info format, where Emacs can
find it, so you can continue to learn about Geiser inside its natural
habitat.  See you there and into the next chapter!

2.4 Friends
===========

Although Geiser does not need them, it plays well with (and is enhanced
by) the following Emacs packages:

   * Paredit (http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ParEdit).  Regardless of
     whether you use Geiser or not, you shouldn't be coding in any Lisp
     dialect without the aid of Taylor Campbell's structured editing
     mode.
   * Company (http://company-mode.github.io/).  Nikolaj Schumacher's and
     Dmitry Gutov's 'company-mode' provides a generic front-end for
     completion engines (such as Geiser's), with pretty and automatic
     completion lists.
   * ac-geiser (https://github.com/xiaohanyu/ac-geiser/) If you prefer
     'auto-complete-mode' to 'company-mode', Xiao Hanyu's 'ac-geiser',
     which provides a Geiser plugin for the popular Emacs Auto
     Completion Mode (http://cx4a.org/software/auto-complete/), is the
     package for you.  Like Geiser, 'ac-geiser' is available in
     Marmalade and MELPA, and also as an 'el-get' package.
   * Quack (http://www.neilvandyke.org/quack/).  You can still use the
     many goodies provided by Neil van Dyke's 'quack-mode', since most
     of them are not (yet) available in Geiser.  The only caveat might
     be a conflict between Quack's and Geiser's default key bindings,
     which i'm sure you'll manage to tackle just fine.  It's also
     probably a good idea to require 'quack' after loading 'geiser.el'
     (or requiring a compiled version).

You just need to install and setup them as usual, for every package's
definition of usual.  Geiser will notice their presence and react
accordingly.

3 The REPL
**********

If you've followed the instructions in *note Installation::, your Emacs
is now ready to start playing.  Otherwise, i'll wait for you: when
you're ready, just come back here and proceed to the following sections.

* Menu:

* Starting the REPL::
* First aids::
* Switching context::
* Completion and error handling::
* Autodoc and friends::
* Seeing is believing::
* Customization and tips::


File: geiser.info,  Node: Starting the REPL,  Next: First aids,  Prev: The REPL,  Up: The REPL

3.1 Starting the REPL
=====================

To start a Scheme REPL (meaning, a Scheme process offering you a
Read-Eval-Print Loop), Geiser provides the generic interactive command
'run-geiser'.  If you invoke it (via, as is customary in Emacs, 'M-x
run-geiser'), you'll be saluted by a prompt asking which one of the
supported implementations you want to launch--yes, you can stop the
asking, see *note below: active-implementations.  Tabbing for completion
will offer you, as of this writing, 'guile' and 'racket'.  Just choose
your poison, and a new REPL buffer will pop up (by default, the REPL
will appear in a new window: if that annoys you, just set
'geiser-repl-use-other-window' to 'nil' and the current window will be
used).

   If all went according to plan, you'll be facing an
implementation-dependent banner, followed by an interactive prompt.
Going according to plan includes having the executable of the Scheme you
chose in your path.  If that's not the case, you can tell Emacs where it
is, as described in *note a moment: impl-binary.  Returning to our REPL,
the first thing to notice is that the funny prompt is telling you your
current module: its name is the part just after the @ sign (in Guile,
that means 'guile-user', while Racket's and Chicken's top namespaces
don't have a name; cf.  discussion in *note Switching context::).  than
that, this is pretty much equivalent to having a command-line
interpreter in a terminal, with a bunch of add-ons that we'll be
reviewing below.  You can start typing sexps right there: Geiser will
only dispatch them for evaluation when they're complete, and will indent
new lines properly until then.  It will also keep track of your input,
maintaining a history file that will be reloaded whenever you restart
the REPL.

   If you're not happy with the faces Geiser is using for the REPL's
prompt and evaluated input, you can customise
'geiser-font-lock-repl-prompt' and 'geiser-font-lock-repl-input' to
better looking faces.

Connecting to an external Scheme
................................

There's an alternative way of starting a Geiser REPL: you can connect to
an external Scheme process, provided it's running a REPL server at some
known port.  How to make that happen depends on the Scheme
implementation.

   If you use Guile, you just need to start your Guile process (possibly
outside Emacs) passing to it the flag '--listen'.  This flag accepts an
optional port as argument (as in '--listen=1969'), if you don't want to
use the default.

   In Racket, you have to use the REPL server that comes with Geiser.
To that end, put Geiser's Racket 'scheme' directory in Racket's
collection search path and invoke 'start-geiser' (a procedure in the
module 'geiser/server') somewhere in your program, passing it the
desired port and, if desired, network interface name.  This procedure
will start the REPL server in a separate thread.  For an example of how
to do that, see the script 'bin/geiser-racket.sh' in the source
distribution, or, if you've compiled Geiser, 'bin/geiser-racket-noinst'
in the build directory, or, if you've installed Geiser, 'geiser-racket'
in '<installation-prefix>/bin'.  These scripts start a new interactive
Racket that is also running a REPL server (they also load the errortrace
library to provide better diagnostics, but that's not strictly needed).

   With your external Scheme process running and serving, come back to
Emacs and execute 'M-x geiser-connect', 'M-x connect-to-guile' or 'M-x
connect-to-racket'.  You'll be asked for a host and a port, and, voila,
you'll have a Geiser REPL that is served by the remote Scheme process in
a dedicated thread, meaning that your external program can go on doing
whatever it was doing while you tinker with it from Emacs.  Note,
however, that all Scheme threads share the heap, so that you'll be able
to interact with those other threads in the running Scheme from Emacs in
a variety of ways.  For starters, all your (re)definitions will be
visible everywhere.  That's dangerous, but will come in handy when you
need to debug your running web server.

   The connection between Emacs and the Scheme process goes over TCP, so
it can be as remote as you need, perhaps with the intervention of an SSH
tunnel.


File: geiser.info,  Node: First aids,  Next: Switching context,  Prev: Starting the REPL,  Up: The REPL

3.2 First aids
==============

A quick way of seeing what else Geiser's REPL can do for you, is to
display the corresponding entry up there in your menu bar.  No, i don't
normally use menus either; but they can come in handy until you've
memorized Geiser's commands, as a learning device.  And yes, i usually
run Emacs inside a terminal, but one can always use La Carte
(http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/LaCarte) to access the menus in a
convenient enough fashion.

   Or just press 'C-h m' and be done with that.

   Among the commands at your disposal, we find the familiar input
navigation keys, with a couple twists.  By default, 'M-p' and 'M-n' are
bound to matching items in your input history.  That is, they'll find
the previous or next sexp that starts with the current input prefix
(defined as the text between the end of the prompt and your current
position, a.k.a.  "point", in the buffer).  For going up and down the
list unconditionally, just use 'C-c M-p' and 'C-c M-n'.  In addition,
navigation is sexp-based rather than line-based.

   There are also a few commands to twiddle with the Scheme process.
'C-c C-q' will gently ask it to quit, while 'C-u C-c C-q' will
mercilessly kill the process (but not before stowing your history in the
file system).  Unless you're using a remote REPL, that is, in which case
both commands will just sever the connection and leave the remote
process alone.  If worse comes to worst and the process is dead, 'C-c
C-z' will restart it.  However, the same shortcut, issued when the REPL
is alive, will bring you back to the buffer you came from, as explained
in *note this section: switching-repl-buff.

   The remaining commands are meatier, and deserve sections of their
own.


File: geiser.info,  Node: Switching context,  Next: Completion and error handling,  Prev: First aids,  Up: The REPL

3.3 Switching context
=====================

In tune with Geiser's modus operandi, evaluations in the REPL take place
in the namespace of the current module.  As noted above, the REPL's
prompt tells you the name of the current module.  To switch to a
different one, you can use the command 'switch-to-geiser-module', bound
to 'C-c C-m'.  You'll notice that Geiser simply uses a couple of
meta-commands provided by the Scheme REPL (the stock ',m' in Guile and
Chicken and the (geiser-defined) ',enter' in Racket), and that it
doesn't even try to hide that fact.  That means that you can freely use
said native ways directly at the REPL, and Geiser will be happy to
oblige.  In Racket, ',enter' works like Racket's standard 'enter!' form,
but you can also provide a path string as its argument (e.g., ',enter
"/tmp/foo.rkt"' is equivalent to ',enter (file "/tmp/foo.rkt")').  Like
'enter!', ',enter' accepts also module names (as in, say, ',enter
geiser/main').  As mentioned, in Guile and Chicken, ',m' is used as is.

   Once you enter a new module, only those bindings visible in its
namespace will be available to your evaluations.  All Schemes supported
by Geiser provide a way to import new modules in the current namespace.
Again, there's a Geiser command, 'geiser-repl-import-module', to invoke
such functionality, bound this time to 'C-c C-i'.  And, again, you'll
see Geiser just introducing the native incantation for you, and you're
free to use such incantations by hand whenever you want.

   One convenience provided by these two Geiser commands is that
completion is available when introducing the new module name, using the
'<TAB>' key.  Pressing it at the command's prompt will offer you a
prefix-aware list of available module names.

   Which brings me to the next group of REPL commands.


File: geiser.info,  Node: Completion and error handling,  Next: Autodoc and friends,  Prev: Switching context,  Up: The REPL

3.4 Completion and error handling
=================================

We've already seen Geiser completion of module names in action at the
minibuffer.  You won't be surprised to know that it's also available at
the REPL buffer itself.  There, you can use either 'C-.' or 'M-`' to
complete module names, and '<TAB>' or 'M-<TAB>' to complete identifiers.
Geiser will know what identifiers are bound in the current module and
show you a list of those starting with the prefix at point.  Needless to
say, this is not a static list, and it will grow as you define or import
new bindings in the namespace at hand.  If no completion is found,
'<TAB>' will try to complete the prefix after point as a module name.

   REPL buffers use Emacs' compilation mode to highlight errors reported
by the Scheme interpreter, and you can use the 'next-error' command
('M-g n') to jump to their location.  By default, every time you enter a
new expression for evaluation old error messages are forgotten, so that
'M-g n' will always jump to errors related to the last evaluation
request, if any.  If you prefer a not-so-forgetful REPL, set the
customization variable 'geiser-repl-forget-old-errors-p' to 'nil'.
Note, however, that even when that variable is left as 't', you can
always jump to an old error by moving to its line at the REPL and
pressing '<RET>'.  When your cursor is away from the last prompt,
'<TAB>' will move to the next error in the buffer, and you can use
'<BACKTAB>' everywhere to go to the previous one.


File: geiser.info,  Node: Autodoc and friends,  Next: Seeing is believing,  Prev: Completion and error handling,  Up: The REPL

3.5 Autodoc and friends
=======================

Oftentimes, there's more you'll want to know about an identifier besides
its name: What module does it belong to?  Is it a procedure and, if so,
what arguments does it take?  Geiser tries to help you answering those
questions too.

   Actually, if you've been playing with the REPL as you read, you might
have notice some frantic activity taking place in the echo area every
now and then.  That was Geiser trying to be helpful (while, hopefully,
not being clippy), or, more concretely, what i call, for want of a
better name, its "autodoc" mode.  Whenever it's active (did you notice
that A in the mode-line?), Geiser's gerbils will be scanning what you
type and showing (unless you silence them with 'C-c C-d C-a')
information about the identifier nearest to point.

   If that identifier corresponds to a variable visible in the current
namespace, you'll see the module it belongs to and its value.  For
procedures and macros, autodoc will display, instead of their value, the
argument names (or an underscore if Geiser cannot determine the name
used in the definition).  Optional arguments are surrounded by
parentheses.  When the optional argument has a default value, it's
represented by a list made up of its name and that value.  When the
argument is a keyword argument, its name has "#:" as a prefix.

   If that's not enough documentation for you, 'C-c C-d d' will open a
separate documentation buffer with help on the symbol at point.  This
buffer will contain implementation-specific information about the
identifier (e.g., its docstring for Guile, or its contract, if any, for
Racket), and a handy button to open the corresponding manual entry for
the symbol, which will open an HTML page (for Racket and Chicken) or the
texinfo manual (for Guile).  If you'd rather go directly to the manual,
try 'C-c C-d i', which invokes 'geiser-doc-look-up-manual' as the handy
button does.

   Geiser can also produce for you a list, classified by kind, of the
identifiers exported by a given module: all you need to do is press 'C-c
C-d m', and type or complete the desired module's name.

   The list of exported bindings is shown, again, in a buffer belonging
to Geiser's documentation browser, where you have at your disposal a
bunch of navigation commands listed in *note our cheat-sheet:
Documentation browser.

   We'll have a bit more to say about the documentation browser in *note
a later section: doc-browser.

   If that's still not enough, Geiser can jump, via 'M-.', to the
symbol's definition.  A buffer with the corresponding file will pop up,
with its point resting upon the identifier's defining form.  When you're
done inspecting, 'M-,' will bring you back to where you were.  As we
will see, these commands are also available in Scheme buffers.  'M-.'
also works for modules: if your point is on an unambiguous module name,
the file where it's defined will be opened for you.

3.6 Seeing is believing
=======================

In schemes that support images as values (currently, that means Racket),
the REPL will display them inline if you're using them in a
graphics-aware Emacs.

   For the terminal, images will appear as buttons: press return on them
to invoke an external viewer (configurable via 'geiser-image-viewer')
that will show you the image at hand.  You can also ask for the same
behaviour on all emacsen by customising 'geiser-repl-inline-images-p' to
'nil'.

   Geiser keeps a cache of the last displayed images in the directory
'geiser-image-cache-dir', which defaults to the system's temp directory,
with up to 'geiser-image-cache-keep-last' files.  You can invoke the
external image viewer on any of them with 'M-x geiser-view-last-image',
which takes a prefix argument to indicate which image number you want, 0
corresponding to the newest one.


File: geiser.info,  Node: Customization and tips,  Prev: Seeing is believing,  Up: The REPL

3.7 Customization and tips
==========================

The looks and ways of the REPL can be fine-tuned via a bunch of
customization variables.  You can see and modify them all in the
corresponding customization group (by using the menu entry or the good
old 'M-x customize-group geiser-repl'), or by setting them in your Emacs
initialisation files (as a rule, all knobs in Geiser are tunable this
way: you don't need to use customization buffers if you don't like
them).

   I'm documenting below a proper subset of those settings, together
with some related tips.

Choosing a Scheme implementation
................................

Instead of using the generic 'run-geiser' command, you can start
directly your Scheme of choice via 'run-racket' or 'run-guile'.  In
addition, the variable 'geiser-active-implementations' contains a list
of those Schemes Geiser should be aware of.  Thus, if you happen to be,
say, a racketeer not to be beguiled by other schemes, you can tell
Geiser to forget about the richness of the Scheme ecosystem with
something like:

     (setq geiser-active-implementations '(racket))

in your initialisation files.

   When starting a new REPL, Geiser assumes, by default, that the
corresponding Scheme binary is in your path.  If that's not the case,
the variables to tweak are 'geiser-guile-binary' and
'geiser-racket-binary', which should be set to a string with the full
path to the requisite binary.

   Before starting the REPL, Geiser will check wether the version of
your Scheme interpreter is good enough.  This means that it will spend a
couple tenths of a second launching and quickly discarding a Scheme
process, but also that the error message you'll get if you're on the
wrong Scheme version will be much more informative.  If you one to avoid
version checks, just check 'geiser-repl-skip-version-check-p' to 't' in
your configuration.

   You can also specify a couple more initialisation parameters.  For
Guile, 'geiser-guile-load-path' is a list of paths to add to its load
path (and its compiled load path) when it's started, while
'geiser-guile-init-file' is the path to an initialisation file to be
loaded on start-up.  The equivalent variables for Racket are
'geiser-racket-collects' and 'geiser-racket-init-file'.

   Note, however, that specifying 'geiser-guile-init-file' is not
equivalent to changing Guile's initialization file ('~/.guile'), because
the former is loaded using the '-l' flag, together with '-q' to disable
loading the second.  But there are subtle differences in the way Guile
loads the initialization file versus how it loads a file specified via
the '-l' flag.  If what you want is just loading '~/.guile', leave
'geiser-guile-init-file' alone and set 'geiser-guile-load-init-file-p'
to 't' instead.

Racket startup time
...................

When starting Racket in little computers, Geiser might have to wait a
bit more than it expects (which is ten seconds, or ten thousand
milliseconds, by default).  If you find that Geiser is giving up too
quickly and complaining that no prompt was found, try to increase the
value of 'geiser-repl-startup-time' to, say, twenty seconds:

     (setq geiser-repl-startup-time 20000)

If you prefer, you can use the customize interface to, well, customise
the above variable's value.

History
.......

By default, Geiser won't record duplicates in your input history.  If
you prefer it did, just set 'geiser-repl-history-no-dups-p' to 'nil'.
History entries are persistent across REPL sessions: they're saved in
implementation-specific files whose location is controlled by the
variable 'geiser-repl-history-filename'.  For example, my Geiser
configuration includes the following line:

     (setq geiser-repl-history-filename "~/.emacs.d/geiser-history")

which makes the files 'geiser-history.guile' and 'geiser-history.racket'
to live inside my home's '.emacs.d' directory.

Autodoc
.......

If you happen to love peace and quiet and prefer to keep your REPL's
echo area free from autodoc's noise, 'geiser-repl-autodoc-p' is the
customization variable for you: set it to 'nil' and autodoc will be
disabled by default in new REPLs.  You can always bring the fairies
back, on a per-REPL basis, using 'C-c C-d C-a'.

Remote connections
..................

When using 'connect-to-guile', 'connect-to-racket' or 'geiser-connect',
you'll be prompted for a host and a port, defaulting to "localhost" and
37146.  You can change those defaults customizing
'geiser-repl-default-host' and 'geiser-repl-default-port', respectively.

Killing REPLs
.............

If you don't want Emacs to ask for confirmation when you're about to
kill a live REPL buffer (as will happen, for instance, if you're exiting
Emacs before closing all your REPLs), you can set the flag
'geiser-repl-query-on-kill-p' to 'nil'.  On a related note, the
customizable variable 'geiser-repl-query-on-exit-p' controls whether
Geiser should ask for confirmation when you exit the REPL explicitly
(via, say, 'C-c C-q', as opposed to killing the buffer), and is set to
'nil' by default.

4 Between the parens
********************

A good REPL is a must, but just about half the story of a good Scheme
hacking environment.  Well, perhaps a bit more than a half; but, at any
rate, one surely needs also a pleasant way of editing source code.
Don't pay attention to naysayers: Emacs comes with an excellent editor
included for about any language on Earth, and just the best one when
that language is sexpy (especially if you use Paredit).  Geiser's
support for writing Scheme code adds to Emacs' 'scheme-mode', rather
than supplanting it; and it does so by means of a minor mode
(unimaginatively dubbed 'geiser-mode') that defines a bunch of new
commands to try and, with the help of the same Scheme process giving you
the REPL, make those Scheme buffers come to life.

4.1 Activating Geiser
=====================

With Geiser installed following any of the procedures described in *note
The easy and quick way:: or *note From the source's mouth::, Emacs will
automatically activate geiser-mode when opening a Scheme buffer.  Geiser
also instructs Emacs to consider files with the extension 'rkt' part of
the family, so that, in principle, there's nothing you need to do to
ensure that Geiser's extensions will be available, out of the box, when
you start editing Scheme code.

   Indications that everything is working according to plan include the
'Geiser' minor mode indicator in your mode-line and the appearance of a
new entry for Geiser in the menu bar.  If, moreover, the mode-line
indicator is the name of a Scheme implementation, you're indeed in a
perfect world; otherwise, don't despair and keep on reading: i'll tell
you how to fix that in a moment.

   The menu provides a good synopsis of everything Geiser brings to the
party, including those keyboard shortcuts we Emacsers love.  If you're
seeing the name of your favourite Scheme implementation in the
mode-line, have a running REPL and are comfortable with Emacs, you can
stop reading now and, instead, discover Geiser's joys by yourself.  I've
tried to make Geiser as self-documenting as any self-respecting Emacs
package should be.  If you follow this route, make sure to take a look
at Geiser's customization buffers ('M-x customize-group <RET> geiser'):
there's lot of fine-tuning available there.  You might also want to take
a glance at the tables in *note our cheat sheet: Cheat sheet.

   Since geiser-mode is a minor mode, you can toggle it with 'M-x
geiser-mode', and control its activation in hooks with the functions
'turn-on-geiser-mode' and 'turn-off-geiser-mode'.  If, for some reason i
cannot fathom, you prefer geiser-mode not to be active by default,
customizing 'geiser-mode-auto-p' to 'nil' will do the trick.

   And if you happen to use a funky extension for your Scheme files that
is not recognised as such by Emacs, just tell her about it with:

     (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.funky-extension\\'" . scheme-mode))

   Now, geiser-mode is just a useless wretch unless there's a running
Scheme process backing it up.  Meaning that virtually all the commands
it provides require a REPL up and running, preferably corresponding to
the correct Scheme implementation.  In the following section, we'll see
how to make sure that that's actually the case.


File: geiser.info,  Node: The source and the REPL,  Next: Documentation helpers,  Prev: Activating Geiser,  Up: Between the parens

4.2 The source and the REPL
===========================

As i've already mentioned a couple of times, geiser-mode needs a running
REPL to be operative.  Thus, a common usage pattern will be for you to
first call 'run-geiser' (or one of its variants, e.g.  'run-guile'), and
then open some Scheme files; but there's nothing wrong in first opening
a couple Scheme buffers and then starting the REPL (you can even find it
more convenient, since pressing 'C-c C-z' in a Scheme buffer will start
the REPL for you).  Since Geiser supports more than one Scheme
implementation, though, there's the problem of knowing which of them is
to be associated with each Scheme source file.  Serviceable as it is,
geiser-mode will try to guess the correct implementation for you,
according to the algorithm described below.

How Geiser associates a REPL to your Scheme buffer
..................................................

To determine what Scheme implementation corresponds to a given source
file, Geiser uses the following algorithm:

  1. If the file-local variable 'geiser-scheme-implementation' is
     defined, its value is used.  A common way of setting buffer-local
     variables is to put them in a comment near the beginning of the
     file, surrounded by '-*-' marks, as in:

          ;; -*- geiser-scheme-implementation: guile -*-

  2. If you've customized 'geiser-active-implementations' so that it's a
     single-element list, that element is used as the chosen
     implementation.
  3. The contents of the file is scanned for hints on its associated
     implementation.  For instance, files that contain a '#lang'
     directive will be considered Racket source code, while those with a
     'define-module' form in them will be assigned to a Guile REPL.
  4. The current buffer's file name is checked against the rules given
     in 'geiser-implementations-alist', and the first match is applied.
     You can provide your own rules by customizing this variable, as
     explained below.
  5. If we haven't been lucky this far and you have customized
     'geiser-default-implementation' to the name of a supported
     implementation, we'll follow your lead.
  6. See?  That's the problem of being a smart aleck: one's always
     outsmarted by people around.  At this point, geiser-mode will
     humbly give up and ask you to explicitly choose the Scheme
     implementation.

   As you can see in the list above, there are several ways to influence
Geiser's guessing by means of customizable variables.  The most direct
(and most impoverishing) is probably limiting the active implementations
to a single one, while customizing 'geiser-implementations-alist' is the
most flexible (and, unsurprisingly, also the most complex).  Here's the
default value for the latter variable:

     (((regexp "\\.scm$") guile)
      ((regexp "\\.ss$") racket)
      ((regexp "\\.rkt$") racket))

which describes the simple heuristic that files with '.scm' as extension
are by default associated to a Guile REPL while those ending in '.ss' or
'.rkt' correspond to Racket's implementation (with the caveat that these
rules are applied only if the previous heuristics have failed to detect
the correct implementation, and that they'll match only if the
corresponding implementation is active).  You can add rules to
'geiser-implementations-alist' (or replace all of them) by customizing
it.  Besides regular expressions, you can also use a directory name; for
instance, the following snippet:

     (eval-after-load "geiser-impl"
       '(add-to-list 'geiser-implementations-alist
                     '((dir "/home/jao/prj/frob") guile)))

will add a new rule that says that any file inside my
'/home/jao/prj/frob' directory (or, recursively, any of its children) is
to be assigned to Guile.  Since rules are first matched, first served,
this new rule will take precedence over the default ones.

   A final tip: if you want Geiser to start automatically a REPL for you
if it notices that there's no one active when it enters geiser-mode, you
can customize 'geiser-mode-start-repl-p' to 't'.

Switching between source files and the REPL
...........................................

Once you have a working geiser-mode, you can switch from Scheme source
buffers to the REPL or 'C-c C-z'.  Those shortcuts map to the
interactive command 'switch-to-geiser'.

   If you use a numeric prefix, as in 'C-u C-c C-z', besides being
teleported to the REPL, the latter will switch to the namespace of the
Scheme source file, as if you had used 'C-c C-m' in the REPL, with the
source file's module as argument; cf.  discussion in *note Switching
context::.  This command is also bound to 'C-c C-a'.

   Once you're in the REPL, the same 'C-c C-z' shortcut will bring you
back to the buffer you jumped from, provided you don't kill the Scheme
process in between.  This is why the command is called switch-to-geiser
instead of switch-to-repl, and what makes it really handy, if you ask
me.

   If for some reason you're not happy with the Scheme implementation
that Geiser has assigned to your file, you can change it with 'C-c C-s',
and you probably should take a look at the previous subsection to make
sure that Geiser doesn't get confused again.

A note about context
....................

As explained before (*note Modus operandi::), all Geiser activities take
place in the context of the current namespace, which, for Scheme
buffers, corresponds to the module that the Scheme implementation
associates to the source file at hand (for instance, in Racket, there's
a one-to-one correspondence between paths and modules, while Guile
relies on explicit 'define-module' forms in the source file).

   Now that we have 'geiser-mode' happily alive in our Scheme buffers
and communicating with the right REPL instance, let us see what it can
do for us, besides jumping to and fro.


File: geiser.info,  Node: Documentation helpers,  Next: To eval or not to eval,  Prev: The source and the REPL,  Up: Between the parens

4.3 Documentation helpers
=========================

Autodoc redux
.............

The first thing you will notice by moving around Scheme source is that,
every now and then, the echo area lights up with the same autodoc
messages we know and love from our REPL forays.  This happens every time
the Scheme process is able to recognise an identifier in the buffer, and
provide information either on its value (for variables) or on its arity
and the name of its formal arguments (for procedures and macros).  That
information will only be available if the module the identifier belongs
to has been loaded in the running Scheme image.  So it can be the case
that, at first, no autodoc is shown for identifiers defined in the file
you're editing.  But as soon as you evaluate them (either individually
or collectively using any of the devices described in *note To eval or
not to eval::) their signatures will start appearing in the echo area.

   Autodoc activation is controlled by a minor mode, 'geiser-autodoc',
which you can toggle with 'M-x geiser-autodoc-mode', or its associated
keyboard shortcut, 'C-c C-d a'.  That /A indicator in the mode-line is
telling you that autodoc is active.  If you prefer that it be inactive
by default (e.g., because you're connecting to a really remote scheme
and want to minimize network exchanges), just set
'geiser-mode-autodoc-p' to 'nil' in your customization files.  Even when
autodoc mode is off, you can use 'geiser-autodoc-show', bound by default
to 'C-c C-d s', to show the autodoc string for the symbol at point.

   The way autodoc displays information deserves some explanation.  It
will first show the name of the module where the identifier at hand is
defined, followed by a colon and the identifier itself.  If the latter
corresponds to a procedure or macro, it will be followed by a list of
argument names, starting with the ones that are required.  Then there
comes a list of optional arguments, if any, enclosed in parentheses.
When an optional argument has a default value (or a form defining its
default value), autodoc will display it after the argument name.  When
the optional arguments are keywords, their names are prefixed with "#:"
(i.e., their names are keywords).  An ellipsis (...) serves as a marker
of an indeterminate number of parameters, as is the case with rest
arguments or when autodoc cannot fathom the exact number of arguments
(this is often the case with macros defined using 'syntax-case').
Another way in which autodoc displays its ignorance is by using an
underscore to display parameters whose name is beyond its powers.

   It can also be the case that a function or macro has more than one
signature (e.g., functions defined using 'case-lambda', or some
'syntax-rules' macros, for which Geiser has often the black magic
necessary to retrieve their actual arities).  In those cases, autodoc
shows all known signatures (using the above rules for each one)
separated by a vertical bar (|).

   As you have already noticed, the whole autodoc message is enclosed in
parentheses.  After all, we're talking about Scheme here.

   Finally, life is much easier when your cursor is on a symbol
corresponding to a plain variable: you'll see in the echo area its name,
preceded by the module where it's defined, and followed by its value,
with an intervening arrow for greater effect.  This time, there are no
enclosing parentheses (i hope you see the logic in my madness).

   You can change the way Geiser displays the module/identifier combo by
customizing 'geiser-autodoc-identifier-format'.  For example, if you
wanted a tilde surrounded by spaces instead of a colon as a separator,
you would write something like:

     (setq geiser-autodoc-identifier-format "%s ~ %s")

in your Emacs initialisation files.  There's also a face
('geiser-font-lock-autodoc-identifier') that you can customize (for
instance, with 'M-x customize-face') to change the appearance of the
text.  And another one ('geiser-font-lock-autodoc-current-arg') that
controls how the current argument position is highlighted.

Other documentation commands
............................

Sometimes, autodoc won't provide enough information for you to
understand what a function does.  In those cases, you can ask Geiser to
ask the running Scheme for further information on a given identifier or
module.

   For symbols, the incantation is 'M-x geiser-doc-symbol-at-point', or
'C-c C-d C-d' for short.  If the associated Scheme supports docstrings
(as, for instance, Guile does), you'll be teleported to a new Emacs
buffer displaying Geiser's documentation browser, filled with
information about the identifier, including its docstring (if any;
unfortunately, that an implementation supports docstrings doesn't mean
that they're used everywhere).

   Pressing 'q' in the documentation buffer will bring you back,
enlightened, to where you were.  There's also a handful of other
navigation commands available in that buffer, which you can discover by
means of its menu or via the good old 'C-h m' command.  And feel free to
use the navigation buttons and hyperlinks that justify my calling this
buffer a documentation browser.

   For Racket, which does not support docstrings out of the box, this
command will provide less information, but the documentation browser
will display the corresponding contract when it's available, as well as
some other tidbits for re-exported identifiers.

   You can also ask Geiser to display information about a module, in the
form of a list of its exported identifiers, using 'C-c C-d C-m', exactly
as you would do in *note the REPL: repl-mod.

   In both cases, the documentation browser will show a couple of
buttons giving you access to further documentation.  First, you'll see a
button named source: pressing it you'll jump to the symbol's definition.
The second button, dubbed manual, will open the Scheme implementation's
manual page for the symbol at hand.  For Racket, that will open your web
browser displaying the corresponding reference's page (using the HTML
browser in Racket's configuration, which you can edit in DrRacket's
preferences dialog, or by setting 'plt:framework-pref:external-browser'
directly in '~/.racket/racket-prefs.rktd'), while in Guile a lookup will
be performed in the texinfo manual.

   For Guile, the manual lookup uses the info indexes in the standard
Guile info nodes, which are usually named "guile" or "guile-2.0".  If
yours are named differently, just add your name to the customizable
variable 'geiser-guile-manual-lookup-nodes'.

   A list of all navigation commands in the documentation browser is
available in *note our cheat-sheet: Documentation browser.

   You can also skip the documentation browser and jump directly to the
manual page for the symbol at point with the command
'geiser-doc-look-up-manual', bound to 'C-c C-d i'.

4.4 To eval or not to eval
==========================

One of Geiser's main goals is to facilitate incremental development.
You might have noticed that i've made a big fuss of Geiser's ability to
recognize context, by being aware of the namespace where its operations
happen.

   That awareness is especially important when evaluating code in your
scheme buffers, using the commands described below.  They allow you to
send code to the running Scheme with a granularity ranging from whole
files to single s-expressions.  That code will be evaluated in the
module associated with the file you're editing, allowing you to redefine
values and procedures to your heart's (and other modules') content.

   Macros are, of course, another kettle of fish: one needs to
re-evaluate uses of a macro after redefining it.  That's not a
limitation imposed by Geiser, but a consequence of how macros work in
Scheme (and other Lisps).  There's also the risk that you lose track of
what's actually defined and what's not during a given session.  But, in
my opinion
(http://programming-musings.org/2009/03/29/from-my-cold-prying-hands/),
those are limitations we lispers are aware of, and they don't force us
to throw the baby with the bathwater and ditch incremental evaluation.
Some people disagree; if you happen to find their arguments
(http://blog.racket-lang.org/2009/03/drscheme-repl-isnt-lisp.html)
convincing, you don't have to throw away Geiser together with the baby:
'M-x geiser-restart-repl' will let you restart the REPL as many times as
you see fit.

   For all of you bearded old lispers still with me, here are some of
the commands performing incremental evaluation in Geiser.

   'geiser-eval-last-sexp', bound to 'C-x C-e', will eval the
s-expression just before point.  If you use a prefix, as in 'C-u C-x
C-e', besides evaluating it the expression is inserted in the the
buffer.

   'geiser-eval-definition', bound to 'C-M-x', finds the topmost
definition containing point and sends it for evaluation.  The variant
'geiser-eval-definition-and-go' ('C-c M-e') works in the same way, but
it also teleports you to REPL after the evaluation.

   'geiser-eval-region', bound to 'C-c C-r', evals the current region.
Again, there's an and-go version available, 'geiser-eval-region-and-go',
bound to 'C-c M-r'.  And, if you want to extend the evaluated region to
the whole buffer, there is 'geiser-eval-buffer', bound to 'C-c C-b' and
its companion 'geiser-eval-buffer-and-go', bound to 'C-c M-b'.

   For all the commands above, the result of the evaluation is displayed
in the minibuffer, unless it causes a (Scheme-side) error (*note To err
perchance to debug::), or, for schemes supporting them (such as Racket),
the evaluation yields an image, in which case you'll see it in popping
up in the Geiser debug buffer (if your Emacs runs under the auspices of
a graphical toolkit), or via an external viewer if you set program (see
also *note Seeing is believing:: for more on image support).

   At the risk of repeating myself, i'll remind you that all these
evaluations will take place in the namespace of the module corresponding
to the Scheme file from which you're sending your code, which, in
general, will be different from the REPL's current module.  And, if all
goes according to plan, (re)defined variables and procedures should be
immediately visible inside and, if exported, outside their module.

   Besides evaluating expressions, definitions and regions, you can also
macro-expand them.  The corresponding key bindings start with the prefix
'C-c C-m' and end, respectively, with 'C-e', 'C-x' and 'C-r'.  The
result of the macro expansion always appears in a pop up buffer.

4.5 To err: perchance to debug
==============================

When an error occurs during evaluation, it will be reported according to
the capabilities of the underlying Scheme REPL.

   In Racket, you'll be presented with a backtrace, in a new buffer
where file paths locating the origin of the error are click-able (you
can navigate them using the <TAB> key, and use <RET> or the mouse to
jump to the offending spot; or invoke Emacs' stock commands 'next-error'
and 'previous-error', bound to 'M-g n' and 'M-g p' by default).

   The Racket backtrace also highlights the exception type, making it
click-able.  Following the link will open the documentation
corresponding to said exception type.  Both the error and exception link
faces are customizable ('geiser-font-lock-error-link' and
'geiser-font-lock-doc-link').

   By default, Geiser will tele-transport your pointer to the debug
buffer: if you prefer to stay in the source buffer, set
'geiser-debug-jump-to-debug-p' to nil.  And if, in addition, you don't
even want to see the error trace, customize 'geiser-debug-show-debug-p',
again, to nil.

   On the other hand, Guile's reaction to evaluation errors is
different: it enters the debugger in its REPL. Accordingly, the REPL
buffer will pop up if your evaluation fails in a Guile file, and the
error message and backtrace will be displayed in there, again click-able
and all.  But there you have the debugger at your disposal, with the
REPL's current module set to that of the offender, and a host of special
debugging commands that are described in Guile's fine documentation.

   In addition, Guile will sometimes report warnings for otherwise
successful evaluations.  In those cases, it won't enter the debugger,
and Geiser will report the warnings in a debug buffer, as it does for
Racket.  You can control how picky Guile is reporting warnings by
customizing the variable 'geiser-guile-warning-level', whose detailed
docstring (which see, using, e.g.  'C-h v') allows me to offer no
further explanation here.  The customization group geiser-guile is also
worth a glance, for a couple of options to fine-tune how Geiser
interacts with Guile's debugger (and more).  Same thing for racketeers
and geiser-racket.

4.6 Jumping around
==================

This one feature is as sweet as it is easy to explain: 'M-.'
('geiser-edit-symbol-at-point') will open the file where the identifier
around point is defined and land your point on its definition.  To
return to where you were, press 'M-,' ('geiser-pop-symbol-stack').  This
command works also for module names: Geiser first tries to locate a
definition for the identifier at point and, if that fails, a module with
that name; if the latter succeeds, the file where the module is defined
will pop up.

   Sometimes, the underlying Scheme will tell Geiser only the file where
the symbol is defined, but Geiser will use some heuristics (read,
regular expressions) to locate the exact line and bring you there.
Thus, if you find Geiser systematically missing your definitions, send a
message to the mailing list <geiser-users@nongnu.org>, and we'll try to
make the algorithm smarter.

   You can control how the destination buffer pops up by setting
'geiser-edit-symbol-method' to either 'nil' (to open the file in the
current window), ''window' (other window in the same frame) or ''frame'
(in a new frame).

4.7 Geiser writes for you
=========================

No self-respecting programming mode would be complete without
completion.  In geiser-mode, identifier completion is bound to
'M-<TAB>', and will offer all visible identifiers starting with the
prefix before point.  Visible here means all symbols imported or defined
in the current namespace plus locally bound ones.  E.g., if you're at
the end of the following partial expression:

     (let ((default 42))
       (frob def

and press 'M-<TAB>', one of the possible completions will be 'default'.

   After obtaining the list of completions from the running Scheme,
Geiser uses the standard Emacs completion machinery to display them.
That means, among other things, that partial completion is available:
just try to complete 'd-s' or 'w-o-t-s' to see why this is a good thing.
Partial completion won't work if you have disabled it globally in your
Emacs configuration: if you don't know what i'm talking about, never
mind: Geiser's partial completion will work for you out of the box.

   If you find the 'M' modifier annoying, you always have the option to
activate 'geiser-smart-tab-mode', which will make the <TAB> key double
duty as the regular Emacs indentation command (when the cursor is not
near a symbol) and Geiser's completion function.  If you want this
smarty pants mode always on in Scheme buffers, customize
'geiser-mode-smart-tab-p' to 't'.

   Geiser also knows how to complete module names: if no completion for
the prefix at point is found among the currently visible bindings, it
will try to find a module name that matches it.  You can also request
explicitly completion only over module names using 'M-`' (that's a
backtick).

   Besides completion, there's also this little command,
'geiser-squarify', which will toggle the delimiters of the innermost
list around point between round and square brackets.  It is bound to
'C-c C-e ['.  With a numeric prefix (as in, say, 'M-2 C-c C-e ['), it
will perform that many toggles, forward for positive values and backward
for negative ones.

************************

Dan Leslie, with the help of his three-months old daughter Freija,
proved there's a smidgen of sense in this madness by adding support for
Chicken to version 0.7 of Geiser, several years after it was born.

   Andy Wingo, Geiser's first user, has been a continuous source of
encouragement and suggestions, and keeps improving Guile and heeding my
feature requests.

   The nice thing about collaborating with Andreas Rottmann over all
these years is that he will not only make your project better with
insightful comments and prodding: he'll send you patches galore too.

   Ludovic Courtès, #geiser's citizen no.  1, joined the fun after a
while, and has since then been a continuous source of encouragement,
ideas and bug reports.

   Michael Wilber convinced me that image support for Racket was not
only fun, but easy, with the best argument: actual code!

   Daniel Hackney and Grant Rettke created the first ELPA packages for
Geiser and taught me to fish.

   Diogo F. S. Ramos is Geiser's most indefatigable user and bug
reporter, and the mailing list has been a far less lonely place since he
came.

   Aleix Conchillo has been my favourite spammer, beta tester and patch
sender during more years and for more projects than i can remember.

   Eduardo Cavazos' contagious enthusiasm has helped in many ways to
keep Geiser alive, and he's become its best evangelist in R6RS circles.

   Alex Kost has contributed with many bug reports and improved Geiser
with several patches.

   Eli Barzilay took the time to play with an early alpha and made many
valuable suggestions, besides answering all my 'how do you in PLT'
questions.

   Matthew Flatt, Robby Findler and the rest of the PLT team did not
only answer my inquiries, but provided almost instant fixes to the few
issues i found.

   Thanks also to the PLT and Guile communities, for showing me that
Geiser was not only possible, but a pleasure to hack on.  And to the
Slime hackers, who led the way.

Joining the fun
