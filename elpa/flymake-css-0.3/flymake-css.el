;;; flymake-css.el --- Flymake support for css using csslint
;;
;;; Author: Steve Purcell <steve@sanityinc.com>
;;; Homepage: https://github.com/purcell/flymake-css
;;; Version: DEV
;; Package-Version: 0.3
;;; Package-Requires: ((flymake-easy "0.1"))
;;
;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Usage:
;;   (require 'flymake-css)
;;   (add-hook 'css-mode-hook 'flymake-css-load)
;;
;; Beware that csslint is quite slow, so there can be a significant lag
;; between editing and the highlighting of resulting errors.
;;
;; Like the author's many other flymake-*.el extensions, this code is
;; designed to configure flymake in a buffer-local fashion, which
;; avoids the dual pitfalls of 1) inflating the global list of
;; `flymake-err-line-patterns' and 2) being required to specify the
;; matching filename extensions (e.g. "*.css") redundantly.
;;
;; Based mainly on the author's flymake-jslint.el, and using the
;; error regex from Arne JÃ¸rgensen's similar flymake-csslint.el.
;;
;; Uses flymake-easy, from https://github.com/purcell/flymake-easy
