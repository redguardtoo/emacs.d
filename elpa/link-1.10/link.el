;; Commentary:

;; This file contains functions for using links in buffers.  A link is
;; a part of the buffer marked with a special face, beeing
;; hightlighted while the mouse points to it and beeing activated when
;; pressing return or clicking the button2.

;; Which each link a function and some data are associated.  Upon
;; clicking the function is called with the data as only argument.
