* Checklist
- Emacs 27 or higher version is required
- Please read FAQ to disable [[http://www.vim.org][Vim]] key bindings
- Please read section "Key bindings" to learn key bindings
- Windows users had better download the version with dependencies bundled. For example, download "emacs-27.2-x86_64.zip" instead of "emacs-27.2-x86_64-no-deps.zip"
- Unstable packages from [[http://melpa.org][MELPA]] are *invisible* but stable packages from [[https://stable.melpa.org][MELPA Stable]] are visible. Please modify variable =melpa-include-packages= in =lisp/init-elpa.el= to install unstable packages
- Other issues are covered in FAQ
* Installation
Please remove =~/.emacs= first. =~= means [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_directory][Home directory]].

Most users need follow the section "Install in normal way".

Section "Install stable version" is useful *if and only if*,
- You don't have network access
- You have never used any command line program

** Install packages from remote repository (RECOMMENDED)
There are two ways to install this setup (I recommend the first way):

First way is to download [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/emacs.d/archive/master.zip][latest setup]] and extract its content into =~/.emacs.d=, OR run command =cd ~; git clone https://github.com/redguardtoo/emacs.d.git .emacs.d= in shell.

Second way is to use [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/emacs.d/archive/stable.zip][stable setup]], or run command =cd ~; git clone https://github.com/redguardtoo/emacs.d.git .emacs.d; cd .emacs.d; git reset --hard stable= in shell.

By default, packages are installed automatically during Emacs startup.

Someone reported that package repository [[http://melpa.org]] is not responsive in China.

No worries. You could answer "YES" to the question "Switch to faster package repositories in China temporarily?" after firing Emacs. Please note after startup you could change variable =package-archives= in =init-elpa.el= to permanently switch to Chinese repositories.
** Install packages from stable local repository (OPTIONAL)
- Download [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/emacs.d/archive/stable.zip]]
- Extract its content into empty directory =~/.emacs.d=
- Download [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/myelpa/archive/stable.zip]]
- Extract the zip somewhere, say =~/projs/myelpa=
- Make sure a file named =archive-contents= exists in =~/projs/myelpa=
- Uncomment the line containing "myelpa" in =lisp/init-elpa.el=. Path =~/myelpa/= could be modified.
- Start Emacs now!

Now you are using local package repository =~/myelpa=.

You can switch to online repositories like http://elpa.gnu.org or http://melpa.org by modifying =lisp/init-elpa.el=.
** Install everything in one step (OPTIONAL)
Download content of [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/my-emacs.d-snapshot]] into =~/.emacs.d=. That's it.

It's not recommended for daily usage because the third party packages are not optimized for latest Emacs.
** Third party programs (OPTIONAL)
*** Install
Most command line programs can be installed through =default package manager=.

=Default package manager= could be:
- [[https://github.com/transcode-open/apt-cyg][apt-cyg]] at Cygwin
- package manager of [[https://www.msys2.org/docs/package-management/][MSYS2]]
- [[https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew][homebrew]] at macOS
- any package manager at Linux (=apt= on Debian/Ubuntu, =yum= on Redhat, =pacman= on Arch, =emerge= on Gentoo ...)

Some package managers allow you to install the program for current user. For example, python package manager =pip= has the option "[[https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/][--user]]".
*** List of command line programs
These programs are *OPTIONAL*.

Please ignore error message related to command line programs. For example, if =aspell= and =hunspell= are not installed, you can ignore all the flyspell error messages.
**** fortune-zh or fortune

* Tutorial (OPTIONAL)
Knowledge of Linux/Unix is required. At least you need know the meanings of "environment variable", "shell", "stdin", "stdout", "man", "info".
** Quickstart
*** Step 1, learn basics
At minimum you need know how Emacs interacts with other command line programs,
- What is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable][Environment Variable]]
- What is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)][Pipeline (Unix)]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams][Standard Streams]]

*** Step 2, read official tutorial
Press =C-h t= in Emacs ("C" means Ctrl key, "M" means Alt key) to read bundled tutorial.

At minimum, you need learn:
- How to move cursor
- =C-h v= to describe variable
- =C-h f= to describe function
- =C-h k= to describe command key binding
*** Step 3, know org-mode basics
[[http://orgmode.org/][Org-mode]] is for notes-keeping and planning.

Please watch [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTwQvgfgMM][Carsten Dominik's talk]]. It's really simple. The only hot key to remember is =Tab=.
*** Step 4, start from a real world problem
You can visit [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/][EmacsWiki]] for the solution. Newbies can ask for help at [[http://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/]].
*** Step 5 (optional), improve your shell/cli skills
You could read free books/guides at [[https://tldp.org/][The Linux Documentation Project]].
** Evil-mode tutorial
Required for vim user,
- Must read [[http://superuser.com/questions/246487/how-to-use-vimtutor][vimtutor]].
- Optionally read [[https://evil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html]]
** Methodology
See [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/mastering-emacs-in-one-year-guide][Master Emacs in One Year]].
* Usage
Original configuration from Emacs or third party packages are respected.

** Quick start
On Windows, you need install Cygwin which provides command line programs to Emacs. Cygwin could be installed on any hard drive but it's highly recommended don't change it relative path to the root driver.

Install Ctags (Universal Ctags is better. Exuberant Ctags is fine). On Windows, you could install Ctags through Cygwin.

Run =M-x counsel-etags-find-tag-at-point= from =counsel-etags= to navigate code. It uses tags files created by ctags. Tags file will be automatically created/update when you start using =counsel-etags=.

Run =M-x counsel-etags-grep= to search text (grep) in project. Project root is automatically detected.

Run =M-x find-file-in-project-by-selected= from =find-file-in-project= to find file in project. Project root is automatically detected. You can also add one line setup in =.emacs= like =(setq ffip-project-root "~/proj1/")=.

Code auto-completion works out of box by using tags file created by Ctags. You need run =counsel-etags= at least once to fire up Ctags. =company-ctags= from =company-mode= provides the candidates for auto completion. No manual setup is required.

Please [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep][grep]] in the directory =~/.emacs.d/lisp= if you have any further questions on setup.
** Better runtime performance
*** Why opening file is slow
Insert below code into =~/.custom.el=, replace "/home/user1/your-file-path" with the file you want to open,
#+begin_src elisp
(defun profile-open-file ()
  (interactive)
  (profiler-start 'cpu)
  (find-file "/home/user1/your-file-path")
  (profiler-report)
  (profiler-stop))
#+end_src

Run =M-x profile-open-file= and read the report.
** Key bindings
Don't memorize any key binding. Try =M-x any-command-in-emacs= and hint for its key binding is displayed.

Most key bindings are defined in =lisp/init-evil.el=, a few key in =lisp/init-hydra.el= which uses [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra][Hydra]].

Press =C-c C-y= anywhere to bring up default hydra menu.

The tutorials I recommended have enough information about commands.

Besides, "[[http://blog.binchen.org/posts/how-to-be-extremely-efficient-in-emacs.html][How to be extremely efficient in Emacs]]" lists my frequently used commands.

Press =kj= to escape from =evil-insert-state= and everything else in Emacs. It's much more efficient than =ESC= in Vim or =C-g= in Emacs. Search =evil-escape= in =init-evil.el= for details.
* FAQ
** Computers with smaller memory
Make sure you have this line in =early-init.el= or at the beginning of =init.el=,
#+begin_src elisp
(setq my-computer-has-smaller-memory-p t)
#+end_src
** Vim vs Emacs
I prefer vim keybindings provided by EVIL.

But mixed style is also used in my workflow. See the function =my-optimize-evil= in =init-evil.el=.

You can insert =(my-optimize-evil)= into =~/.custom.el= to enable it.
** Backup packages
Run =M-x elpamr-create-mirror-for-installed= create a local repository from installed packages. See [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/elpa-mirror]] for more details.
** Hardcore debug technique
This Emacs configuration is fast and robust.

So most tricky problems come from extra third party packages you installed.

Try [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strace][Strace]] if you can't resolve the issue by grepping the Emacs Lisp code.

Debug network request sent by Emacs,
#+begin_src sh
strace -f -e trace=network -s 10000 -o ~/emacs-err.txt /usr/bin/emacs -nw
#+end_src

Debug system API call sent by Emacs,
#+begin_src sh
strace -o ~/emacs-err.txt /usr/bin/emacs -nw
#+end_src
** Spell check code
This configuration uses [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/wucuo][wucuo]] which is alternative of =flyspell-mode= and =flyspell-prog-mode=.

Wucuo is fast, reliable, and powerful. It's better than any spell checking solutions of other text and IDE.

If you prefer your own spell check solution, insert below code to disable wucuo first,
#+begin_src elisp
(setq my-disable-wucuo t)
#+end_src

For further knowledge on spell checking, you could read [[http://blog.binchen.org/posts/what-s-the-best-spell-check-set-up-in-emacs.html][my article]] and code in =init-spelling.el=.
** Lock packages
Some packages are so important to my workflow that they are locked.

Those packages are placed at =site-lisp/=.

They will not be upgraded by package system.

Please make sure same package is not installed through elpa. Please check the content of directory "elpa/" in =.emacs.d= root.
** How to install new packages?
I only use two package repositories,
- [[https://stable.melpa.org]] (holding stable packages)
- [[https://melpa.org]] (holding latest but unstable packages)

If a package named =MY-PKG= exists in the stable repository, you only need one line setup,
#+begin_src elisp
(require-package 'MY-PKG)
#+end_src

This line could be placed in =lisp/init-elpa.el= or =~/.custom.el=.

You'd better place everything related to =MY-PKG= into =~/.custom.el= so the main stream change won't impact your own configuration.

If the package does not exist in the stable repository, modify =melpa-include-packages= in =lisp/init-elpa.el= first.

I encourage you to read =init-elpa.el= to understand how packages are managed if you are good at Emacs Lisp,
** Git blame current line
Run =vc-msg-show=.

If you select a region inside current line, the *correct commit which submits the selected snippet* is displayed instead of the latest commit touch the whole line.
** Save/Load windows layout
=SPC s s= or =M-x wg-create-workgroup= to save windows layout.
=SPC l l= or =M-x wg-open-workgroup= to load windows layout.

** Use this configuration as merge tool for Git
This configuration might be the most efficient and most powerful merge tool for VCS.
Insert below configuration into =~/.gitconfig=,
#+begin_src js
[mergetool.ediff]
# use git mergetool ediff to resolve conflicts
cmd = emacs -nw -Q --eval \"(setq startup-now t)\" -l \"~/.emacs.d/init.el\" --eval \"(progn (setq ediff-quit-hook 'kill-emacs) (if (file-readable-p \\\"$BASE\\\") (ediff-merge-files-with-ancestor \\\"$LOCAL\\\" \\\"$REMOTE\\\" \\\"$BASE\\\" nil \\\"$MERGED\\\") (ediff-merge-files \\\"$LOCAL\\\" \\\"$REMOTE\\\" nil \\\"$MERGED\\\")))\"
#+end_src

Then run =git mergetool -t ediff= to resolve conflicts.

Here is [[https://gist.github.com/redguardtoo/d4ecd51f785bd117a6a0][my ~/.gitconfig]]. You can use [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/test-git-mergetool]] to practice.
** Default terminal shell
Run =M-x shell=. If you use Zsh instead of Bash, please modify =init-term-mode.el=.

You can customize =my-term-program= whose default value is =/bin/bash=. It's used by =ansi-term=.
** Override default setup
Place your setup in =~/.custom.el= which is loaded after other "*.el".

So you can use any functions defined in my emacs configuration.

Here is a sample to override keybindings defined in =lisp/init-evil.el=,
#+begin_src elisp
(with-eval-after-load 'evil
  (my-space-leader-def
    "ss" 'pwd
    "ll" 'pwd
    "pp" 'pwd))
#+end_src
** Code navigation
It's usable out of box if Ctags is installed.

To navigate, =M-x counsel-etags-find-tag-at-point=.

To enable code auto-completion, =M-x counsel-etags-scan-code= at least once.

Optionally, you can add =(add-hook 'after-save-hook 'counsel-etags-virtual-update-tags)= into your =.emacs= to automatically update tags file.

No further setup is required.
** Code auto-completion
I assume you are using [[https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode][company-mode]]. In this setup, users can press digit key to select the candidate from =company-mode=. To disabled this feature, =(setq my-company-select-by-number-p nil)=. Please see =my-company-zero-key-for-filter= for more tips.

*** C++ auto-completion doesn't work?
There are many ways to scan the C++ source files. =company-clang= from =company-mode= and =Clang= is good at handling C++.

If you use clang to parse the C++ code:
- Make sure code is syntax correct
- assign reasonable value into =company-clang-arguments=

Here is sample setup:
#+begin_src elisp
(setq company-clang-arguments '("-I/home/myname/projs/test-cmake" "-I/home/myname/projs/test-cmake/inc"))
#+end_src

In "friendly" Visual C++, [[http://www.codeproject.com/Tips/588022/Using-Additional-Include-Directories][similar setup]] is required.

You can use other backends instead of =clang=. For example, you can use =company-gtags= and [[https://www.gnu.org/software/global/][GNU Global]] instead. See [[http://blog.binchen.org/posts/emacs-as-c-ide-easy-way.html][Emacs as C++ IDE, easy way]] for details.

*** Auto-completion for other languages
It's similar to C++ setup. Since GNU Global supports many popular languages, you can use =company-gtags=.

For languages GNU Global doesn't support, you can fall back to =company-ctags= and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ctags][Ctags]]. Ctags configuration file is =~/.ctags=.

You can also complete line by =M-x eacl-complete-line= and complete multi-lines statement by =M-x eacl-complete-multiline=.
** Color theme
*** Auto load classic color theme
Add below code to =~/.custom.el= to load a random classic dark color theme during startup,
#+begin_src elisp
(setq my-enable-startup-color-theme-p t)
#+end_src

If you prefer using your own color theme, you don't need above line.

*** Preview color theme
Check [[https://emacsthemes.com/]].

Write down the name of color theme (for example, molokai).

*** Setup color theme manually (recommended)
You can =M-x counsel-load-theme= to switch themes.

Or you can insert below code into end of =~/.custom.el= or =init.el=,
#+begin_src elisp
;; Please note the color theme's name is "molokai"
(load-theme 'molokai t)
#+end_src

You can also run =M-x random-color-theme= to load random color theme.
*** Use color theme in terminal
Use 256 colors is just one CLI without any extra setup,
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
TERM=xterm-256color emacs -nw
#+END_SRC
** True colors in terminal Emacs
- Install Emacs 26
- Install [[https://gist.github.com/XVilka/8346728][terminals supporting true color]]. I suggest [[https://mintty.github.io/][mintty]] on Windows, [[https://gnometerminator.blogspot.com/p/introduction.html][terminator]] on Linux, [[https://www.iterm2.com/][iTerm2]] on macOS
- [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/efaq/Colors-on-a-TTY.html][Set up and start Emacs]]
** Grep/Replace text in project
Many third party plugins bundled in this setup have already provided enough features. For example, if you use =git=, =counsel-git-grep= from package [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][counsel/ivy]] works out of the box.

A generic grep program =counsel-etags-grep= is also provided. Since =counsel-etags-grep= is based on =counsel/ivy=, it also supports a magic called "multi-editing via Ivy". You could read [[https://sam217pa.github.io/2016/09/11/nuclear-power-editing-via-ivy-and-ag/][Nuclear weapon multi-editing via Ivy and Ag]] to get the idea.

Multi-edit workflow is optimized. After =M-x counsel-etags-grep= or pressing =,qq=, press =C-c C-o C-x C-q= to enable =wgrep-mode=. You can edit text (for example, delete lines) in =wgrep-mode= directly.

You can exclude multiple keywords using =!keyword1 keyword2= in =ivy=.
** Hydra/Swiper/Counsel/Ivy
I love all the packages from [[https://github.com/abo-abo][Oleh Krehel (AKA abo-abo)]]. Every article from his [[https://oremacs.com/][blog]] is worth reading ten times.

You can input =:pinyin1 pinyin2 !pinyin3 pinyin4= in ivy UI to search by Chinese Pinyin. The key point is to make sure the first character of input is ":".
** Set "auto-mode-alist"
The =auto-mode-alist= associates major modes with files.

For example, associate =rjsx-mode= file with extension "*.jsx",
#+begin_src elisp
(push ("\\.jsx\\'" . rsjx-mode) auto-mode-alist)
#+end_src

Or you can use function =my-add-auto-mode= provided by this configuration,
#+begin_src elisp
(my-add-auto-mode 'rjsx-mode "\\.jsx\\'")
#+end_src
** git-gutter
I use modified version of =git-gutter= for now until my pull request is merged into official repository.

You can set =git-gutter:exp-to-create-diff= to make git gutter support other VCS (Perforce, for example),
#+begin_src elisp
(setq git-gutter:exp-to-create-diff
      (shell-command-to-string (format "p4 diff -du -db %s"
                                       (file-relative-name buffer-file-name))))
#+end_src

Please note =git-gutter= assumes the cli program [[https://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/][diff]] is added into environment variable PATH.  You might need install it through MSYS2 or Cygwin on Windows.
** Setup fonts in GUI Emacs
Non-Chinese can use [[https://github.com/rolandwalker/unicode-fonts][unicode-fonts]].

Chinese can use [[https://github.com/tumashu/cnfonts][cnfonts]].

They are not included in this setup. You need install them manually.
** Synchronize setup with Git
Synchronize from my stable setup:
#+begin_src bash
git pull https://redguardtoo@github.com/redguardtoo/emacs.d.git stable
#+end_src

Or latest setup:
#+begin_src bash
git pull https://redguardtoo@github.com/redguardtoo/emacs.d.git
#+end_src

You can revert commit:
#+begin_src bash
# always start from the latest related commit
git revert commit-2014-12-01
git revert commit-2014-11-01
#+end_src
** Indentation
Learn [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/IndentationBasics][basics]]. Then use [[http://blog.binchen.org/posts/easy-indentation-setup-in-emacs-for-web-development.html][my solution]].
** Editing Lisp
Please note [[http://emacswiki.org/emacs/ParEdit][paredit-mode]] is enabled when editing Lisp. Search "paredit cheat sheet" to learn its key bindings.
** Use [[https://github.com/Malabarba/smart-mode-line][smart-mode-line]] or [[https://github.com/milkypostman/powerline][powerline]]?
Comment out =(require 'init-modeline)= in =init.el= at first.
** Key bindings don't work?
Other desktop applications may intercept the key bindings. For example, [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/emacs.d/issues/320][it's reported QQ on windows 8 can intercept "M-x"]].
** Org-mode
Press =M-x org-version=, then read online manual to set up.

For example, =org-capture= requires [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Setting-up-capture.html#Setting-up-capture][manual setup]].

Run =M-x org-open-at-point= to open link under cursor. Http link will be opened by built in browser. =C-u M-x org-open-at-point= uses the external browser specified by =browse-url-generic-program= whose value could be =/usr/bin/firefox=.
** macOS user?
Please replace legacy Emacs 22 and ctags with the new versions.

The easiest way is change [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)][Environment variable PATH]].
** Customize global variables
Some variables are set by this configuration so you can't =M-x customize= to modify them.

Here are the steps to set these variables:
- Find the variable description by =M-x customize=. For example, if the description of a variable is "Company Clang Insert Arguments", then the variable name is =company-clang-insert-argument=
-  Find the variable =company-clang-insert-argument= in =lisp/init-company.el= and change its value

BTW, please *read my code comment* first before changing my code.
** Open/Save files with Counsel/Ivy
Keep pressing =C-M-j= to ignore candidates and open/save files using current input.

You can also press =M-o= to apply other action on selected file. See [[https://oremacs.com/2015/07/23/ivy-multiaction/]] for details.
** Windows
If you use Windows Emacs, you need Emacs to find third party command line programs from Cygwin/MSYS2. Please add =C:\Cygwin64\bin= or =C:\msys64\bin= to environment variable =PATH=.

Most command line programs are originally developed for macOS and Linux. They can only handle UTF-8 encoded text. When grepping texts or searching files, the Windows Emacs need run the command line programs in Command Prompt which uses UTF-16 encoded text. So you might need see [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57131654/using-utf-8-encoding-chcp-65001-in-command-prompt-windows-powershell-window?noredirect=1&lq=1][Using UTF-8 Encoding (CHCP 65001) in Command Prompt / Windows Powershell (Windows 10)]] if Emacs need pass Non-ASCII text to external command line programs.

Below Emacs commands do not require external command line programs and work out of box on Windows,
- `M-x swiper`
- `M-x ffip-lisp-find-file-in-project`
- `M-x find-lisp-find-dired`
- `M-x find-by-pinyin-dired`
- `M-x find-by-pinyin-in-project-dired`

You can set environment variables in PowerShell, like,
#+begin_src sh
setx var_name "var_value"
#+end_src

Environment variable =HOME= points to the directory =C:\Users\<username>= on Windows by default. You need copy the folder =.emacs.d= into that directory. Or you can change the value of =HOME=.

I use below cli to set the variable =HOME= to "c:\cygwin\home\cb",
#+begin_src sh
setx HOME "c:\cygwin\home\cb"
#+end_src

** Yasnippet
- Instead of =M-x yas-expand= or pressing =TAB= key, you can press =M-j= instead.
- Yasnippet works out of box. But you can =M-x my-yas-reload-all= to force Yasnippet compile all the snippets. If you run =my-yas-reload-all= once, you always need run it when new snippets is added. The purpose of =my-yas-reload-all= is to make Emacs start up faster.
- You can add your snippets into =snippets/=.
- Run =grep -rns --exclude='.yas*' 'key:' *= in =snippets/= to see my own snippets
** Non-English users
Locale must be *UTF-8 compatible*. For example, as I type =locale= in shell, I got the output =zh_CN.UTF-8=.
** Behind corporate firewall
Run below command in shell:
#+begin_src bash
http_proxy=http://yourname:passwd@proxy.company.com:8080 emacs -nw
#+end_src
** Network is blocked
Try [[https://github.com/XX-net/XX-Net]]. Run command =http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8087 emacs -nw= in shell after starting XX-Net.
** Email
If you use Gnus for email, check =init-gnus.el= and read [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/mastering-emacs-in-one-year-guide/blob/master/gnus-guide-en.org][my Gnus tutorial]].
** Cannot download packages?
Some package cannot be downloaded automatically because of network problem.

Run =M-x package-refresh-content=, restart Emacs, reinstall package.
** Use packages on [[https://elpa.gnu.org/][GNU ELPA]]
By default, packages from GNU ELPA are NOT available. Search the line "uncomment below line if you need use GNU ELPA" in =init-elpa.el= if you want to access GNU ELPA.

For example, [[https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck][flycheck]] requires packages from GNU ELPA.
** Use flycheck to syntax check code
If you prefer =flycheck= instead the default syntax check solution =lazyflymake= built into this configuration.

Install and set up =flycheck= and insert below code to disable =lazyflymake=,
#+begin_src elisp
(setq my-disable-lazyflymake t)
#+end_src
** Disable Vim key bindings
By default EVIL (Vim emulation in Emacs) is used. Comment out line containing =(require 'init-evil)= in init.el to unload it.
** Evil setup
It's defined in =lisp/init-evil.el=. Press =C-z= to switch between Emacs and Vim key bindings.

You could visit [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil/][its website]] to download its free ebook there.

You can set =my-initial-evil-state-setup= to customize the initial evil state per major mode,
#+begin_src elisp
;; `diff-mode' uses Emacs original key bindings
(push '(diff-mode . emacs) my-initial-evil-state-setup)
;; `ivy-occur-grep-mode' initial state is evil normal state. Vim key bindings are used.
(push '(ivy-occur-grep-mode . normal) my-initial-evil-state-setup)
#+end_src
** Chinese Input Method Editor
Please note pyim is already built into this setup. You need not install it through ELPA.

Run =M-x toggle-input-method= to toggle input method [[https://github.com/tumashu/pyim][pyim]].
*** Use Pinyin
The default dictionary for pinyin might not be big enough. So you need install bigger dictionaries.

Dictionaries with ".pyim" extension under the directory =~/.eim/= are automatically loaded.

Please run =curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redguardtoo/pyim-tsinghua-dict/master/pyim-tsinghua-dict.pyim > ~/.eim/pyim-tsinghua-dict.pyim= to install extra dictionaries.

The default pinyin scheme is =quanpin= but you can insert below code into =~/.custom.el= to switch to a different pinyin scheme,
#+begin_src elisp
(with-eval-after-load 'pyim
  (setq pyim-default-scheme 'xiaohe-shuangpin))
#+end_src
*** Use Wubi
Dictionary for wubi is already installed. Please insert below code into =~/.custom.el= to enable wubi dictionary and use wubi scheme,
#+begin_src elisp
(setq my-pyim-enable-wubi-dict t)
;; ;; @see https://github.com/tumashu/pyim-wbdict for more information
;; (setq my-pyim-enable-wubi-dict pyim-wbdict-v86-enable)
;; (setq my-pyim-enable-wubi-dict pyim-wbdict-v98-enable)
;; (setq my-pyim-enable-wubi-dict pyim-wbdict-v98-morphe-enable)
;; (setq my-pyim-enable-wubi-dict pyim-wbdict-v86-single-enable)
#+end_src
** Install multiple versions of Emacs
Run below commands to install Emacs 26.3 into the directory =~/myemacs/26.3=:
#+begin_src bash
mkdir -p ~/tmp;
curl http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/emacs-26.3.tar.gz | tar xvz -C ~/tmp/emacs-26.3
cd ~/tmp/emacs-26.3;
mkdir -p ~/myemacs/26.3;
rm -rf ~/myemacs/26.3/*;
./configure --prefix=~/myemacs/26.3 --without-x --without-dbus --without-sound && make && make install
#+end_src
** Change Time Locale
Insert below code into =~/.emacs= or =~/.custom.el=,
#+begin_src elisp
;; Use en_US locale to format time.
;; if not set, the OS locale is used.
(setq system-time-locale "C")
#+end_src
** Directory structure
=init.el= is the main file. It includes other =*.el= files.

=lisp/init-elpa.el= defines what packages will be installed from [[http://melpa.org][MELPA]].

Packages are installed into the directory =elpa/=.

I also manually download and extract some packages into =site-lisp/=. Packages in =site-lisp/= are *not visible* to the package manager.

My own snippets is at =snippets/=.

The git hooks is placed in =githooks= directory.

Other directories don't matter.
** Run the unit test before git commit
On macOS/Linux/Cygwin, run =make githooks= to install hooks into =.git/hooks=.

Then unit test is run automatically before =git commit=.
** Python environment
[[https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy][Elpy (Emacs Python Development Environment)]] is used.

The flag =elpy-disable-backend-error-display= is set to =nil= so you can easily report any error to its developers.

If you don't use Elpy, comment out the line =(elpy-enable)= in =init-python.el=.

To enable the virtual environment created by Elpy, add below code into =~/.custom.el=,
#+begin_src elisp
(with-eval-after-load 'elpy
  (let* ((venv-dir "~/.emacs.d/elpy/rpc-venv"))
    (when (and (file-exists-p venv-dir)
               (executable-find pyvenv-virtualenvwrapper-python))
      (pyvenv-activate venv-dir))))
#+end_src

After activating the virtual environment created by Elpy, you could backup its required packages,
#+begin_src sh
source ~/.emacs.d/elpy/rpc-venv/bin/activate && pip freeze > elpy-requirements.txt && deactivate
#+end_src

Restore the packages,
#+begin_src sh
source ~/.emacs.d/elpy/rpc-venv/bin/activate && pip install -r elpy-requirements.txt && deactivate
#+end_src

Then run =M-x elpy-config= to double check elpy status and install any missing python package.

You might want to modify =include-system-site-packages= in =~/.emacs.d/elpy/rpc-venv/pyvenv.cfg=
** Set up [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode][lsp-mode]]
You could insert below code into =~/.custom.el=,
#+begin_src elisp
(with-eval-after-load 'lsp-mode
  ;; enable log only for debug
  (setq lsp-log-io nil)
  ;; use `evil-matchit' instead
  (setq lsp-enable-folding nil)
  ;; no real time syntax check
  (setq lsp-diagnostic-package :none)
  ;; handle yasnippet by myself
  (setq lsp-enable-snippet nil)
  ;; turn off for better performance
  (setq lsp-enable-symbol-highlighting nil)
  ;; use find-fine-in-project instead
  (setq lsp-enable-links nil)
  ;; auto restart lsp
  (setq lsp-restart 'auto-restart)
  ;; don't watch 3rd party javascript libraries
  (push "[/\\\\][^/\\\\]*\\.\\(json\\|html\\|jade\\)$" lsp-file-watch-ignored)
  ;; don't ping LSP language server too frequently
  (defvar lsp-on-touch-time 0)
  (defun my-lsp-on-change-hack (orig-fun &rest args)
    ;; do NOT run `lsp-on-change' too frequently
    (when (> (- (float-time (current-time))
                lsp-on-touch-time) 120) ;; 2 mins
      (setq lsp-on-touch-time (float-time (current-time)))
      (apply orig-fun args)))
  (advice-add 'lsp-on-change :around #'my-lsp-on-change-hack))
#+end_src

Then run =M-x lsp= to start lsp client and server. Check [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode]] on how to install lsp server.
** Enable typewriter sounds when typing
Run =M-x my-toggle-typewriter=. Please check bundled =typewriter-mode.el= for further setup.
** pdf-tools
Check its official documentation.

Here is my setup in =~/.custom.el=,
#+begin_src elisp
;; @see https://github.com/vedang/pdf-tools/
;; Don't bother Windows
(when (and (display-graphic-p) (or *linux* *is-a-mac*))
  (my-run-with-idle-timer
   2
   (lambda ()
     (when *is-a-mac*
       (setenv "PKG_CONFIG_PATH" "/usr/local/Cellar/zlib/1.2.8/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:/opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig"))
     (pdf-loader-install))))
#+end_src
* Support legacy Emacs versions
** Emacs 26
Version 4.0 is the last version to support =Emacs 26=
Please use [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/emacs.d/archive/4.0.zip]] and [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/myelpa/archive/4.0.zip]].

** Emacs 25
Version 3.2 is the last version to support =Emacs 25=

Please use [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/emacs.d/archive/3.1.zip]] and [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/myelpa/archive/3.1.zip]].
** Emacs 24.4 and 24.5
Version 2.9 is the last version to support =Emacs 24.4+=

Please use [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/emacs.d/archive/2.9.zip]] and [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/myelpa/archive/2.9.zip]].
** Emacs 24.3
Version 2.6 is the last version to support =Emacs 24.3=.

Download [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/emacs.d/archive/2.6.zip]] and [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/myelpa/archive/2.6.zip]] and you are good to go.
** Emacs 23
Version 1.2 of this setup is the last version to support Emacs v23.

Here are the steps to use that setup:
- Download [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/emacs.d/archive/1.2.zip]]
- Download [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/myelpa/archive/1.2.zip]]
- Follow the section =Install stable version in easiest way= but skip the download steps
* Tips
- Never turn off any bundled mode if it's on by default. Future version of Emacs may assume it's on. Tweak its flag in mode hook instead!
- Git skills are *extremely useful*. Please read the chapters "Git Basics", "Git Branching", "Git Tools" from [[https://git-scm.com/book/en/][Pro Git]]
- You can run =optimize-emacs-startup= to compile "*.el" under =lisp/=
- Many advanced features in this configuration is only enabled in my personal =~/.custom.el=. Grep =defvar my-.*= in =~/.emacs.d/lisp/= to find them.  You can start from =init-company.el= and =init-spelling.el=.
* Report bug
Please check [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/][EmacsWiki]] and my FAQ first.

If you still can't resolve the issue,
- Restart Emacs with option =--debug-init= in shell
- Run =M-x toggle-debug-on-error= in Emacs
- Reproduce the issue and send me the error message

The full command line to start Emacs is =emacs -nw --debug-init=.

If you use [[https://emacsformacosx.com][Emacs for Mac OS X]], the command line is =/Application/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs -nw --debug-init=.

Send error messages to the original developer if it's third party package's problem.

If *you are sure* it's this my bug, file report at [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/emacs.d]]. Don't email me!

Bug report need include *environment details*.
